# HealthRAG: UX Vision - Personal Daily Coach
**The Dashboard Your Coach Would Show You**

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

A real coach doesn't say:
- ❌ "Most people need 10-20 sets"
- ❌ "Based on your profile, you should..."

A real coach says:
- ✅ "**Jason**, per your goals [cut to 185 lbs, 3 days/week], **THIS is your program THIS WEEK**"
