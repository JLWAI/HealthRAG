\f1\b \cf0 What makes a glute exercise S tier? 
\f0\b0 \
0:00\
the glutes are one of the single most\
0:01\
important muscles for building an\
0:03\
impressive physique they're also one of\
0:04\
the largest muscles in the body so\
0:06\
regardless of whether you're a man or\
0:08\
you're a woman building this one muscle\
0:10\
will make it immediately obvious that\
0:11\
you lift from the side and the rear so\
0:14\
in this video I'm ranking the best and\
0:16\
worst glute exercises for muscle growth\
0:18\
using the latest exercise signs we'll go\
0:21\
from s tier for super all the way down\
0:23\
to F tier for fail and at the end I'll\
0:26\
show you what I think are the very best\
0:28\
and the very worst glute exercises of\
0:30\
all time now in order to figure out\
0:31\
which exercises are better we need to\
0:33\
understand some very basic glute Anatomy\
0:36\
first the Glu are technically three\
0:38\
distinct muscles there's the very large\
0:40\
glutitis Maximus which is the real\
0:42\
powerhouse of your lower body it extends\
0:44\
your hips like in a deadlift and\
0:46\
externally rotates your leg like when\
0:48\
you point your toes out there's the\
0:49\
glutitis medius which is about 1/3 of\
0:51\
the size of the glutitis Maximus but\
0:53\
it's still well worth focusing on it's\
0:55\
still quite big it has about the same\
0:57\
amount of muscle mass as your delts and\
0:59\
since it sit on the upper glutes it'll\
1:01\
enhance that appearance of a upper glute\
1:03\
shelf the glute medius is very active\
1:05\
during hip abduction where you sweep\
1:07\
your leg out to the side and it's a very\
1:09\
important stabilizer so it's especially\
1:11\
active during single leg exercises and\
1:14\
there's the even smaller glute Minimus\
1:15\
which is about half the size of the\
1:17\
glute medius but also plays a key\
1:19\
stabilization role and can add size to\
1:21\
the upper glutes in addition to being\
1:22\
split into those three separate muscles\
1:24\
your glutes can also be divided into an\
1:26\
upper middle and lower portion and as we\
1:29\
go I'll reveal my number one exercise\
1:31\
for each division of the glutes hidden\
1:34\
behind these three doors so keep in mind\
1:36\
that just because an exercise gets into\
1:38\
s tier doesn't necessarily mean it's s\
1:40\
tier for the entire glutes it might be S\
1:42\
tier for targeting one specific area and\
1:45\
here's my criteria for ranking glute\
1:47\
exercises to get into s tier the\
1:49\
exercise needs to provide high tension\
1:51\
especially in the stretched position it\
1:53\
should feel good which means it doesn't\
1:55\
cause knee hip or low back pain and\
1:57\
there should be some way of progressing\
1:58\
the exercise over time which is\
2:00\
ultimately what'll keep your glutes\
2:01\
growing okay let's start with the most\
2:03\
popular glute exercise on the internet\
2:05\
the hip thrust the barbell hip thrust is\

\f1\b Barbell Hip Thrust
\f0\b0 \
2:07\
oddly enough one of the more studied\
2:09\
movements in all of exercise science\
2:11\
there's a pile of studies showing that\
2:13\
it is in fact very effective at growing\
2:15\
the glutes the hip thrust will activate\
2:17\
the entire glute the upper middle and\
2:19\
lower but mainly Target that middle meat\
2:21\
because it isolates hip extension it's a\
2:23\
great movement for Progressive overload\
2:25\
you can almost always add a little\
2:26\
weight each week while keeping your form\
2:28\
tight I don't think you need a 500 hip\
2:30\
thrust to grow your glutes but if your\
2:32\
glutes are getting stronger on this\
2:33\
movement somewhere in the 5 to 15 rep\
2:35\
range then your glutes are also getting\
2:37\
bigger there is a slight issue though a\
2:39\
lot of people find that the barbell\
2:41\
pinches their hips you can alleviate\
2:42\
this to some degree by using a big cushy\
2:44\
pad or even rolling up some yoga mats or\
2:46\
by strategically placing the bar in that\
2:48\
cushy crease of your hip below the\
2:50\
anterior superior iliac spine and above\
2:52\
the pubic bone but even if you avoid\
2:54\
that painful pinching it can still feel\
2:56\
awkward it also takes time to set up\
2:58\
especially if you don't have a hip\
2:59\
Thruster platform or if you're loading a\
3:00\
lot of plates the hip thrust also\
3:02\
doesn't get the glutes into a super deep\
3:04\
stretch even a deep range of motion hip\
3:06\
thrust only gets the glutes into about\
3:07\
90\'b0 of hip flexion compared to the 130\'b0\
3:11\
of range that's possible for most\
3:12\
lifters but this isn't as much of a deal\
3:15\
breaker as you might think I don't know\
3:16\
that the glutes need a Ultra deep\
3:18\
stretch to grow a recent 9we study with\
3:20\
untrained subjects found that the hip\
3:22\
thrust was just as effective as the\
3:24\
squat at growing the glutes despite the\
3:26\
fact that the squat does stretch the\
3:27\
glutes more now that's just one study\
3:29\
other research does suggest that the\
3:31\
glutes respond well to deeper training\
3:33\
so like other muscles I suspect the\
3:34\
glutes will grow best from a combination\
3:36\
of exercises that challenge them in a\
3:38\
more stretched position like the squat\
3:40\
plus exercises that challenge them in a\
3:42\
more shortened position like the hip\
3:44\
thrust as an overall glute Max Builder\
3:47\
I'm putting the barbell hip thrust into\
3:49\
high B tier now if you have access to a\

\f1\b Machine Hip Thrust
\f0\b0 \
3:51\
good hip thrust machine like this\
3:53\
Nautilus glute Drive I think you can\
3:54\
solve a few of those issues the belt is\
3:56\
much more comfy than a barbell you also\
3:58\
don't need to set anything up up and\
4:00\
because the machine is very stable you\
4:02\
won't need to use any balance and should\
4:04\
be able to focus on engaging your glutes\
4:06\
better I personally do these every\
4:07\
single week and I think they belong in\
4:09\
high a tier and I'm actually going to\
4:11\
pick them as my number one option for\
4:13\
the middle aspect of the glutes their\
4:15\
only downside as I see it is the lack of\
4:17\
a really deep stretch but we'll pick\
4:18\
that up with some other exercises\
4:20\
another really good option is the single\

\f1\b Single-Leg Dumbbell Hip Thrust
\f0\b0 \
4:22\
leg dumbbell hip thrust these will hit\
4:24\
the entire glutes but unlike the other\
4:26\
options May shift some emphasis to the\
4:28\
upper glutes because the glute me medius\
4:30\
and Minimus will need to stabilize for\
4:31\
balance you can also prevent left to\
4:33\
right muscle imbalances by focusing on\
4:35\
each glute individually and I don't like\
4:37\
to go heavy here just stick to 12 to 15\
4:39\
reps and really focus on controlling the\
4:41\
movement they're going in a tier as well\

\f1\b Glute Bridge
\f0\b0 \
4:43\
the glute bridge is really just a hip\
4:45\
thrust but with less range of motion\
4:47\
they're a bit easier to set up because\
4:48\
you don't need a bench and they're great\
4:49\
for beginners because they require less\
4:51\
stabilization some people also say they\
4:53\
can isolate their glutes more with these\
4:54\
by taking some of the quads out but I\
4:56\
still prefer the hip thrust because it\
4:58\
has more range of motion low B tier frog\
5:00\
pumps are also kind of like a hip thrust\

\f1\b Frog Pumps
\f0\b0 \
5:02\
except you externally rotate your hips\
5:04\
and clamp your feet together this will\
5:06\
shift some emphasis to the upper glutes\
5:08\
since abducting your hips will Engage\
5:09\
The glute medius more actually don't\
5:11\
hate these as a high rep finisher but\
5:13\
they're hard to load which forces you to\
5:15\
use really High Reps and they don't\
5:16\
stretch the glutes very well I'm putting\
5:18\
them in high CER all right so let's take\
5:20\
a look at some exercises that actually\
5:22\
do stretch the glutes quite a lot we'll\
5:24\
start with squats I think squats are a\

\f1\b Barbell Back Squat
\f0\b0 \
5:26\
super underrated glute Builder on social\
5:28\
media like the hip thrust you're\
5:30\
extending your hips so you'll activate\
5:31\
all regions of the glutes but especially\
5:33\
that middle chunk I would say most of my\
5:35\
own glute development does come from\
5:36\
squats and my background and\
5:38\
powerlifting the only potential downside\
5:40\
of squats is that they don't really\
5:41\
isolate the glutes well you get a huge\
5:43\
quad stimulus too so if you're only\
5:45\
trying to grow your glutes without\
5:47\
growing your quads squats aren't your\
5:49\
best option that said you can make the\
5:50\
movement more glute dominant by placing\
5:52\
the bar a few inches lower on your back\
5:54\
leaning further forward and focusing on\
5:56\
really driving through your hips also\
5:58\
research shows that squatting deeper is\
6:00\
important for glute growth so try to at\
6:02\
least break parallel despite some\
6:03\
limitations I'm still putting the\
6:05\
barbell squat in a tier for glute growth\
6:07\
with a Smith machine squat you can place\

\f1\b Smith Machine Squat
\f0\b0 \
6:09\
your feet further forward to make it\
6:10\
more glute dominant and you never need\
6:12\
to worry about losing your balance it's\
6:14\
also going in a tier the Bulgarian split\

\f1\b Bulgarian Split Squat
\f0\b0 \
6:16\
squat gets a deeper stretch on the\
6:17\
glutes than the standard barbell Squat\
6:19\
and because they're single leg in\
6:21\
addition to the middle glutes you'll get\
6:23\
the upper glutes more involved to make\
6:24\
them even more glute focused place your\
6:26\
front foot further forward and lean\
6:28\
forward as you squat again think about\
6:30\
driving through your hips rather than\
6:32\
just standing up with your knees this\
6:34\
will help you engage your glutes a lot\
6:35\
better these are very close to S tier\
6:37\
but they are a bit harder to overload\
6:39\
especially if you do them with dumbbells\
6:41\
they also smoke your quads and are a\
6:42\
really exhausting movement in general I\
6:45\
usually do two sets per leg and call it\
6:47\
there I'm Feeling High a tier before I\
6:49\
get to our first s tier exercise let's\
6:51\
knock out a couple Duds donkey kicks\

\f1\b Donkey Kicks
\f0\b0 \
6:53\
probably don't grow your glutes very\
6:54\
well they're really hard to overload\
6:56\
even with a band you're still getting\
6:58\
very little tension while the glutes are\
6:59\
stretched and it's hard to progressively\
7:01\
overload using a band anyway I think\
7:03\
they're solid as a warm-up activation\
7:04\
drill or to help beginners feel their\
7:06\
glutes engage but as a glute hypertrophy\
7:08\
exercise these are going in low D tier\

\f1\b Fire Hydrants
\f0\b0 \
7:11\
fire hydrants have similar issues they\
7:12\
just don't get high tension on the\
7:14\
glutes they can work for Mobility or in\
7:16\
rehab contexts but I'm putting them in\
7:18\
low D tier as a glute Builder all right\
7:20\
let's look at some exercises that Target\
7:21\
the upper glutes hibs are great for the\

\f1\b Kickback
\f0\b0 \
7:24\
upper glutes especially if you kick up\
7:26\
and out diagonally that's because the\
7:28\
upper glute fibers perform both hip\
7:29\
extension which is the up part and hip\
7:32\
abduction which is the out and\
7:34\
diagonally part Kickbacks are actually\
7:36\
very stable if you brace Against the\
7:37\
Machine and perhaps even more stable if\
7:39\
you brace against a bench the resistance\
7:40\
profile should feel nice and smooth you\
7:42\
don't get the biggest stretch but that\
7:44\
can be made up with other exercises that\
7:45\
we'll get to I don't do a whole lot of\
7:47\
Kickbacks myself but I do think they're\
7:48\
a really great option if you like them\
7:50\
or if you want to isolate the glutes\
7:52\
without hitting quads I'm thinking low a\
7:54\
tier step up so Target the upper glutes\

\f1\b Step Ups
\f0\b0 \
7:56\
because you're doing one leg at a time\
7:57\
and the stability requirement in enges\
7:59\
the glute medius and Minimus they get a\
8:01\
deep stretch on the entire glute\
8:03\
especially if you set the Box a little\
8:04\
higher at or just above knee level which\
8:06\
will force your glutes to work harder\
8:08\
than your quads if you have a handle to\
8:10\
grab onto you can keep your balance\
8:11\
better and overload the glutes even more\
8:13\
they can be a bit awkward at first but\
8:15\
once you learn how to engage your glutes\
8:16\
more than your quads I think they're\
8:18\
killer low a tier machine hip abductions\

\f1\b Machine Hip Abduction
\f0\b0 \
8:20\
are fantastic for the upper glutes\
8:22\
that's because they really challenge the\
8:24\
glute medius and Minimus directly\
8:26\
through their primary function of hip\
8:28\
abduction if you Lean Forward by about\
8:30\
30\'b0 you'll improve the line of pull of\
8:32\
those upper glute fibers and you should\
8:33\
feel a deeper stretch at the bottom I\
8:35\
usually do these for 15 to 20 reps\
8:37\
although heavier low rep work is also\
8:39\
good you can always progressively\
8:40\
overload the movement by just increasing\
8:42\
the pin weight and when you eventually\
8:43\
max out the stack you can use a gym pin\
8:45\
to add more if you want a little extra\
8:46\
range of motion you can add an extra pad\
8:48\
on the inside and while it may not be\
8:50\
the best overall glute Builder it's just\
8:52\
so good at targeting the upper glutes\
8:54\
and for that reason it's our first\
8:56\
exercise going into s tier and it's also\
8:58\
my number one exercise for the upper\
9:00\
glutes making it the reveal behind door\
9:02\
number one cable hip abductions do the\

\f1\b Cable Hip Abduction
\f0\b0 \
9:04\
same basic thing but I find them harder\
9:05\
to overload they're not quite as stable\
9:07\
and they're a bit more annoying to set\
9:08\
up I'm thinking B tier the lateral\
9:10\
banded walk is the same basic movement\

\f1\b Lateral Banded Walk
\f0\b0 \
9:12\
pattern but the band offers virtually\
9:14\
zero tension in the stretch these are\
9:16\
fine enough as a warm-up drill or for\
9:17\
helping people engage their glute medius\
9:19\
better but they're just not going to add\
9:20\
much meat to your glutes unless you're a\
9:22\
beginner I'm putting them in C tier okay\

\f1\b Walking Lunge
\f0\b0 \
9:25\
speaking of stretching the glutes let's\
9:26\
talk about lunges lunges will hit the\
9:29\
enti higher glute you'll get the upper\
9:30\
glutes because of glute medius\
9:31\
activation due to the stabilization\
9:33\
demands you'll get the mid glutes from\
9:34\
the hip extension and the lower glute\
9:36\
area from the deep stretch as you lunge\
9:38\
you can accentuate that stretch by\
9:40\
taking longer strides forward and by\
9:41\
leaning slightly forward by about 30\'b0\
9:44\
there are many different ways to do\
9:45\
lunges but I like old school walking\
9:47\
lunges the best I like the idea that\
9:49\
you're moving through space it gives you\
9:50\
something to actually work toward rather\
9:52\
than just doing reps on the spot I find\
9:54\
that more motivating and sure while you\
9:56\
can probably get a slightly better\
9:57\
stretch with Bulgarian split squats if\
9:59\
you take big steps on lunges you'll feel\
10:02\
a massive glute stretch too and even\
10:04\
though soreness isn't everything I get\
10:05\
more sore from lunges than anything else\
10:07\
I'm a huge fan of walking lunges and I'm\
10:09\
sending them straight to S tier Smith\
10:11\
machine lunges have all the same\

\f1\b Smith Machine Lunge
\f0\b0 \
10:13\
benefits but again I just don't like\
10:15\
doing all my reps on the spot when I\
10:16\
have the option to move through space\
10:18\
that's more of a personal preference\
10:19\
thing but I'm still putting these in\
10:21\
high a tier if you elevate your front\

\f1\b Smith Machine Lunge (Front Foot Elevated)
\f0\b0 \
10:23\
foot on a small box you'll get a bit\
10:25\
more range of motion at the bottom which\
10:27\
is just enough to sneak these into s\
10:29\
tier with curtsy lunges you step back\

\f1\b Curtsy Lunge
\f0\b0 \
10:31\
diagonally behind your other leg this\
10:33\
requires more balance meaning it'll\
10:35\
activate the glute medius more so\
10:37\
another good option for the upper glutes\
10:39\
that said I think because they're harder\
10:40\
to overload I don't think they're quite\
10:42\
as good as a standard lunge they're\
10:44\
definitely an option you can include\
10:45\
every now and then but I'm feeling low B\
10:47\
tier okay let's cover three lower glute\
10:49\
Builders first up the deadlift the\

\f1\b Deadlift
\f0\b0 \
10:52\
conventional deadlift is a good glute\
10:53\
Builder since it trains hip extension it\
10:55\
gives a big stretch on the lower glutes\
10:57\
and it's amazing for Progressive\
10:58\
overload the issue is it's just such a\
11:00\
fatiguing exercise physically and\
11:02\
psychologically this is why it's said to\
11:04\
have a low stimulus to fatigue ratio you\
11:07\
get a lot of stimulus but you also get a\
11:09\
lot of fatigue especially in muscles\
11:11\
other than the glutes like the spinal\
11:13\
Erectors as a strength Builder it's\
11:14\
elite but as a glute hypertrophy\
11:16\
exercise I have to put it in low B tier\
11:19\
the Sumo deadlift is very similar this\

\f1\b Sumo Deadlift
\f0\b0 \
11:21\
EMG study found no difference in glute\
11:23\
Maximus EMG activity between\
11:25\
conventional and Sumo stances that said\
11:27\
because of the hip abduction and hip\
11:28\
external rotation from The Wider stance\
11:30\
and the foot flare the Sumo deadlift\
11:32\
probably does hit the glute medius\
11:34\
harder and might shift some emphasis\
11:36\
toward the upper glutes I'm putting it\
11:38\
in high B tier as a glute Builder the\
11:40\
Romanian deadlift is the better choice\

\f1\b Romanian Deadlift
\f0\b0 \
11:42\
for glute hypertrophy in my opinion\
11:44\
especially for the lower glutes in that\
11:45\
glute hamstring tie-in area and while it\
11:48\
does hit the hamstrings hard as well it\
11:49\
smashes the glute Max as a basic\
11:51\
compound lift that's very conducive to\
11:53\
Progressive overload I'm Feeling High a\
11:56\
tier and this is actually my number one\
11:57\
exercise for the lower glutes but it's\
11:59\
not my number one exercise of all before\
12:01\
we get to that let's knock out three\
12:03\
final exercises one that I love one that\
12:05\
I hate and one that's just okay I love\

\f1\b 45-Degree Back Extension
\f0\b0 \
12:08\
the 45\'b0 back extension a lot of people\
12:10\
think of it as just a low back exercise\
12:12\
but since you're extending your hips\
12:14\
your entire glutes will be very active\
12:16\
in both the lengthen position at the\
12:18\
bottom and the shortened position at the\
12:20\
top I prefer to overload these by adding\
12:22\
reps but you can still work up to Some\
12:24\
solid weight by holding plates to your\
12:25\
chest if you round your upper back on\
12:27\
these you should be able to connect with\
12:28\
your glue much better I'm honestly\
12:30\
feeling s tier for these cable pull\

\f1\b Cable Pull Through
\f0\b0 \
12:33\
throughs are okay for me they're great\
12:34\
for beginners without much glute\
12:36\
strength but eventually you'll be\
12:37\
limited by how much weight you can hold\
12:39\
comfortably they just start to feel\
12:40\
awkward once you get some real weight on\
12:42\
there I'm thinking low be here I'm not a\
12:44\
big fan of kettle bell swings you can\

\f1\b Kettlebell Swing
\f0\b0 \
12:46\
definitely get a good cardio workout\
12:47\
with these and I think they do have some\
12:49\
utility for building explosive power but\
12:51\
for glute hypertrophy you're just not\
12:53\
getting enough tension low D tier okay\
12:55\
and if I had to pick just one exercise\
12:57\
from s tier to raise it up to S Plus as\
13:00\
the best of the best I think I'd have to\
13:02\
go with the walking lunge I realize\
13:04\
that's a hot take but these are all\
13:05\
great glute Builders and if I had to\
13:07\
personally just pick one I think it\
13:09\
would be the walking lunge and I'll go\
13:10\
with the donkey kick or the fire hydrant\
13:12\
as the worst of the worst not because\
13:14\
they can't have their place as warm-up\
13:15\
drills but it's just really hard to\
13:16\
reach high glute tension for muscle\
13:18\
growth I'm actually really trying to\
13:19\
bring up my own glutes this year so I'm\
13:21\
doing a ton of hip thrusts hip\
13:22\
abductions and walking lunges but it's\
13:24\
not enough to just dial your training in\
13:26\
your diet is also crucial you need need\
13:29\
to ensure that you're eating the right\
13:30\
number of calories and protein to\
13:32\
support muscle growth and so many people\
13:34\
still underestimate the impact of diet\
13:36\
on your physique dialing in my own diet\
13:38\
over the last year made a gigantic\
13:40\
difference in my progress so if you'd\
13:42\
like to get on track yourself you can\

\f1\b \cf0 What makes a biceps exercise great?
\f0\b0 \
0:00\
the biceps get a lot of attention and\
0:02\
for good reason simply growing this one\
0:04\
muscle can make a dramatic difference in\
0:06\
how jacked you look in a t-shirt so in\
0:08\
this video I'll be covering the best and\
0:10\
worst biceps exercises based on the\
0:12\
latest science I'm going to rank them on\
0:14\
a tier list from s for super to F for\
0:17\
fail and at the end I'll Crown one\
0:19\
exercise as the best of the best and\
0:21\
I'll pick one as the worst of the worst\
0:23\
and here's my criteria for ranking\
0:25\
exercises to get into s tier it needs to\
0:28\
provide high tension especially in the\
0:30\
stretched position it needs to feel good\
0:32\
which means it doesn't cause elbow pain\
0:34\
and it has a smooth resistance profile\
0:36\
and it should have a simple progression\
0:39\
that's ultimately what keeps your arms\
0:40\
growing if you can't add weight or reps\
0:42\
over time I'm knocking it down now the\
0:44\
biceps have two heads as the name biceps\
0:46\
implies there's a short head which sits\
0:48\
on the inside of your arm and a long\
0:50\
head which sits on the back of your arm\
0:52\
and contributes more to that elusive\
0:54\
biceps Peak there's also another big\
0:56\
muscle that sits underneath the biceps\
0:58\
called the Breaky Alis and it's actually\
1:00\
just as big as both heads of the biceps\
1:03\
combined and it can also help push the\
1:05\
biceps up more creating bigger Peaks so\
1:08\
it's an important muscle and as we go\
1:10\
we'll consider which variations will\
1:12\
Target which head and along the way\
1:14\
we'll see that there's some decent\
1:15\
evidence that you most likely can Target\
1:17\
your biceps Peak and there's one\
1:19\
exercise in particular that I think you\
1:21\
should definitely include if you're\
1:22\
trying to bring up your Peaks now the\
1:24\
biceps perform two main biomechanical\
1:26\
functions elbow flexion which is when\
1:29\
you bend your elbow like in a curl and\
1:31\
supination which is when you turn your\
1:33\
palm facing up you can try this out for\
1:35\
yourself if you start with your palm\
1:36\
facing down and then slowly turn it up\
1:39\
you'll notice that your biceps\
1:40\
automatically contract and I cue for\
1:42\
this subnation by thinking about driving\
1:44\
through my pinkies as I curl both heads\
1:46\
of the biceps also cross the shoulder\
1:48\
joint which means the biceps will be\
1:50\
more stretched when the arm is held back\
1:52\
behind the Torso okay let's start with\
1:54\
the most popular biceps exercise of all\

\f1\b Barbell Curl
\f0\b0 \
1:56\
time the barbell curl right away we can\
1:58\
see that tension on the bicep STS isn't\
2:00\
exactly optimal the hardest part of the\
2:02\
range is when the elbow is at 90\'b0 and\
2:05\
above that tension goes down and below\
2:07\
that tension also goes down until it\
2:09\
reaches zero tension at the very bottom\
2:12\
and the very bottom is also when the\
2:14\
biceps are most stretched so this most\
2:16\
likely isn't ideal but you'll still grow\
2:18\
your biceps as long as you're pushing\
2:20\
hard and the barbell curl is very good\
2:22\
for overload you can easily add a little\
2:24\
weight each week the biggest issue is\
2:26\
that the straight barbell puts some\
2:27\
strain on my wrists Plus in public gems\
2:30\
hugging up a squat rack just to do curls\
2:32\
is bad etiquette that's because you can\
2:34\
do curls so many different ways but you\
2:36\
really need a squat rack to do barbell\
2:38\
squats All Things Considered I think the\
2:39\
barbell curl belongs in C tier plus but\
2:42\
I'll bump it up to B tier just because\
2:44\
it's so accessible the easy bar curl is\

\f1\b EZ Bar Curl
\f0\b0 \
2:46\
the same thing except the handles curve\
2:48\
in a way that eases up some torque on my\
2:50\
wrists I use the outer part of the Easy\
2:52\
Bar Because a shoulder width grip feels\
2:54\
more comfortable this grip angle puts\
2:56\
you in between a fully supinated grip\
2:58\
like You' use on barbell curls and a\
3:00\
neutral grip like you'd use on hammer\
3:02\
curls however if you use this in between\
3:04\
angled grip you will take your biceps\
3:06\
out of subnation to some degree this\
3:09\
means it might shift some tension toward\
3:10\
the brachialis and bracho radialis\
3:13\
instead of the biceps per se so to make\
3:15\
sure my biceps are still firing I simply\
3:17\
think about driving through my pinkies\
3:19\
as I curl problem solved I actually\
3:21\
really like the easy bar curl especially\
3:23\
has a heavy free weight bicep movement\
3:25\
in the 6 to8 rep range from an\
3:27\
optimization standpoint it probably\
3:29\
belongs in B tier but I'm going to go\
3:31\
ahead and bump it up to a tier because\
3:33\
it's still an exercise I do quite often\
3:35\
for the convenience Simplicity and\

\f1\b Standing DB Curl
\f0\b0 \
3:37\
overload the standing dumbbell curl has\
3:39\
zero tension in the full stretch just\
3:41\
like the barbell and easy bar curl\
3:42\
honestly I might have made a bigger\
3:44\
stink about this if I made this video a\
3:45\
few months ago before our new study came\
3:47\
out on full range of motion versus\
3:49\
length and persels in experienced\
3:50\
trainees check out this video for more\
3:52\
on that so the dumbbell Cur loses one\
3:54\
point for the suboptimal tension curve\
3:56\
but it's still a very convenient\
3:58\
exercise that'll still grow your arms\
4:00\
it's also nice that you get to work each\
4:01\
side individually which can help fix\
4:03\
bicep size asymmetries doing alternating\
4:05\
dumbbell curls might be slightly less\
4:07\
optimal just because your biceps get\
4:09\
this long rest in between each rep the\
4:11\
study from goto and colleagues makes me\
4:13\
think that doing those long pauses\
4:15\
without any tension in between reps\
4:17\
probably is a bit worse for muscle\
4:18\
growth as long as you're doing both arms\
4:20\
at the same time I think the dumbbell\
4:22\
curl belongs in low a tier doing your\
4:24\
dumbbell curls as preacher curls\

\f1\b DB Preacher Curl
\f0\b0 \
4:26\
immediately makes the exercise better\
4:28\
that's because by angling your upper arm\
4:30\
you actually pull more tension into your\
4:32\
biceps in the stretched position and\
4:34\
even though your arm is out in front of\
4:36\
you you still get a pretty good stretch\
4:38\
here as long as you go all the way down\
4:40\
and more importantly you have high\
4:42\
tension in that stretched position and\
4:44\
having high tension in a stretched\
4:46\
position seems to be more important than\
4:48\
the total stretch that a muscle\
4:50\
experiences this was shown in a recent\
4:52\
study that compared incline curls to\
4:54\
preacher curls the preacher curl caus\
4:55\
significantly more distal biceps growth\
4:58\
growth closer to the Elbow joint that's\
5:00\
most likely because with the preacher\
5:01\
curl you get very high tension in a\
5:04\
pretty good stretch while with the\
5:05\
incline curl you get basically no\
5:08\
tension in a very big stretch pracher\
5:10\
curls also lock your elbows in place\
5:12\
making it near impossible to cheat\
5:13\
there's basically nothing I can knock it\
5:15\
for so the preach curl definitely\
5:17\
belongs in s tier and as for incline\

\f1\b Incline Curl
\f0\b0 \
5:20\
curls since we now have that study\
5:22\
showing that they are a bit worse than\
5:23\
preure curls they have to go in a lower\
5:25\
tier I still do them from time to time\
5:27\
since they're a solid lengthened biased\
5:29\
movement that's fast to set up and easy\
5:31\
to do I'm still putting them in low a\
5:33\
tier the lying dumbbell curl is\

\f1\b Lying DB Curl
\f0\b0 \
5:35\
basically just the more extreme version\
5:37\
of the incline curl I first saw these in\
5:39\
Dr Mike's arm routine so I tried them\
5:41\
out for myself while they do look a bit\
5:43\
wonky they actually felt pretty solid\
5:45\
you get this huge stretch especially\
5:47\
near the top of your bicep close to your\
5:49\
shoulder this felt great to me but if\
5:51\
you have shoulder issues you might want\
5:52\
to skip this one also unlike the incline\
5:54\
curl when I lie down I can feel more\
5:57\
tension in my biceps in that most\
5:59\
stretch stretched starting position so\
6:01\
while it's a bit too early for me to say\
6:02\
if I like it better than the standard\
6:03\
incline curl I definitely think it's\
6:05\
worth trying out and I'm putting it in a\
6:07\
tier now the Scott curl is basically\

\f1\b Scott Curl
\f0\b0 \
6:09\
just a preacher curl with a vertical arm\
6:11\
and while the man who it's named after\
6:13\
had some of the most impressive biceps\
6:14\
of all time I don't think it's the best\
6:16\
biceps exercise that's because by\
6:18\
placing your arm vertically you remove\
6:20\
all the tension in the stretched\
6:21\
position it's basically just a worse\
6:23\
version of the 45\'b0 pre-ra curl so I just\
6:26\
don't see why you do it and for that\
6:27\
reason it's going in C here on the other\

\f1\b Flat Bench Curl
\f0\b0 \
6:30\
hand the flat bench curl is basically a\
6:32\
pretr curl with the bench angle\
6:33\
completely horizontal doing curls this\
6:36\
way will cause the highest bicep tension\
6:38\
in the most stretched position and then\
6:41\
tension drops off throughout the\
6:42\
positive I was doing these for a while\
6:44\
as a high rep finisher but I found\
6:45\
myself gravitating back toward the\
6:47\
standard 45\'b0 pre-ural lately I found you\
6:50\
just hit a wall with your progression on\
6:51\
these because you're limited to light\
6:52\
weights and High Reps as a high rep\
6:54\
burnout with a really big stretch\
6:56\
emphasis I think they're good but they\
6:58\
got old for me quickly I'm putting them\
7:00\
in low B tier the machine preacher curl\

\f1\b Machine Preacher Curl
\f0\b0 \
7:02\
has the added benefit of being nice and\
7:04\
locked in actually only do these in the\
7:06\
bottom half of the range to emphasize\
7:07\
the stretch a bit more and I do these\
7:09\
every single week they're easily going\
7:11\
in s tier but they're still not my\
7:14\
number one bicep Builder before we get\
7:15\
to that let's knock out the waiter curl\

\f1\b Waiter Curl
\f0\b0 \
7:17\
this is probably the most gimmicky\
7:19\
biceps exercise I actually see people do\
7:21\
it cranks your wrists the plate feels\
7:23\
awkward and you're limited with overload\
7:25\
I just use dumbbells instead and if you\
7:27\
really want to hyperextend your wrists a\
7:28\
bit to help take your swms out you can\
7:30\
still do that with dumbbells but with\
7:32\
more degrees of freedom I'm putting\
7:33\
waiter curls in F tier the drag curl\

\f1\b Drag Curl
\f0\b0 \
7:36\
does have potential because by moving\
7:37\
your arm back as you curl you do put the\
7:40\
bicep under a greater degree of stretch\
7:42\
however as you curl you're shortening\
7:44\
the bicep at the elbow joint while\
7:46\
simultaneously lengthening it at the\
7:48\
shoulder joint this means that the total\
7:50\
biceps muscle length doesn't actually\
7:52\
change much throughout the range of\
7:53\
motion it's kind of similar to how the\
7:55\
total hamstrings muscle length doesn't\
7:57\
change much on a squat and we know that\
7:59\
squats don't grow the hamstrings very\
8:01\
well so even if there's no direct\
8:03\
science on it I still think the drag\
8:05\
curl wouldn't grow the biceps as well as\
8:07\
a more standard dumbbell curl it's going\
8:09\
in C tier the spider curl is the other\

\f1\b Spider Curl
\f0\b0 \
8:12\
overrated exercise by shifting your arms\
8:14\
forward in front of your body you're\
8:16\
putting your biceps in a very shortened\
8:17\
position so at no point in this range of\
8:20\
motion will your biceps experience a\
8:22\
high degree of stretch the dumbbells can\
8:24\
also annoyingly hit the bench and throw\
8:27\
off your groove so spider curls are\
8:29\
going going in C tier okay chinups if\

\f1\b Chin-Ups
\f0\b0 \
8:32\
you look at these from a side angle you\
8:33\
can see that there's actually a pretty\
8:35\
solid range of motion at the elbow joint\
8:37\
and out of all the back exercises I do\
8:39\
think these will grow your biceps the\
8:40\
most however because so much of your\
8:42\
back musculature is also involved it's\
8:44\
unlikely that your biceps will be the\
8:46\
limiting factor and so while they\
8:48\
clearly will grow your biceps especially\
8:50\
as a beginner I don't think they're as\
8:52\
good as most isolation exercises that\
8:54\
said because they're so accessible all\
8:56\
you need is your own body weight I'm\
8:57\
still putting them in B tier\
9:00\
okay let's have some fun 21s are a sort\

\f1\b 21s
\f0\b0 \
9:02\
of bro exercise where you do seven reps\
9:04\
in the bottom half then seven reps in\
9:06\
the top half and then you finish with\
9:08\
seven full range of motion reps this is\
9:10\
a fun way to challenge your arms but I\
9:12\
just don't think it's in the right order\
9:13\
traditional 21s has you hit the\
9:15\
lengthened part first which is probably\
9:17\
the most anabolic then you hit the\
9:19\
shortened part which is the least\
9:21\
anabolic and then the full range of\
9:23\
motion last so the order is long short\
9:26\
full I think it's a lot smarter to do\
9:28\
these short then full then long so I do\
9:32\
seven seated curls first which trains\
9:34\
the shortened top half obviously you\
9:36\
could just do these standing but I find\
9:38\
doing them seated standardizes the range\
9:40\
on each rep and keeps it more\
9:41\
interesting then I stand up and do seven\
9:43\
full ROM curls and then I do seven\
9:46\
bottom half curls at the end this way\
9:48\
the curls get a little easier as your\
9:50\
biceps fatigue and this way you get to\
9:52\
end the set with a bunch of length and\
9:54\
partials I don't always stop at exactly\
9:56\
seven reps at the end either I just keep\
9:58\
going until I can't get at least halfway\
10:01\
up so if you do 21s the old school way I\
10:03\
think they belong in high C tier but if\
10:06\
you do them the modified way I think\
10:07\
they can get into low a tier okay let's\
10:10\
rank some cable exercises the standard\

\f1\b Standard Cable Curl
\f0\b0 \
10:12\
cable curl is good but not great by\
10:15\
having your arms at your sides you don't\
10:16\
get a big pre-stretch in your biceps I\
10:18\
do still include these periodically\
10:20\
though because you do get this nice even\
10:22\
tension throughout the range of motion\
10:24\
and I do think they're just good enough\
10:25\
to get into low a tier however by\
10:27\
flipping around and facing away from\

\f1\b Face Away Bayesian Cable Curl
\f0\b0 \
10:29\
from the cable you immediately improve\
10:31\
the tension profile by placing your arms\
10:33\
back behind your torso you get maximum\
10:35\
stretch on the biceps and you still get\
10:38\
that nice even tension throughout the\
10:40\
range I recommend setting up the cable\
10:42\
at around hand height taking one or two\
10:44\
steps forward and curling with both arms\
10:47\
at the same time now if you don't have a\
10:48\
dual stack cable machine you can always\
10:50\
do one arm at a time and if you're\
10:51\
trying to bring up your biceps Peak this\
10:53\
is an exercise I definitely wouldn't\
10:55\
skip because the long head will\
10:57\
experience a very high degree of stretch\
10:59\
and tension it's probably not my number\
11:02\
one exercise for the peak I'll get to\
11:03\
that in a second the face away Bean\
11:05\
cable curl is going in s tier of course\
11:08\
it is it's amazing all right this is a\

\f1\b Bayesian Cable Curl Variation
\f0\b0 \
11:11\
freaky looking variation on the beian\
11:12\
cable curl that I've been playing around\
11:14\
with lately I don't have a name for it\
11:15\
yet so I'll open it up to suggestions in\
11:17\
the comments the cool thing about this\
11:19\
variation is that you actually get this\
11:20\
90\'b0 angle between the cable and your\
11:22\
forarm while the bicep is most stretched\
11:25\
this means you're getting maximum\
11:27\
tension on the biceps while they're in\
11:29\
their most stretched position they were\
11:31\
a little awkward the first time I tried\
11:32\
them but once I figured out the right\
11:34\
cable height they felt fantastic I'm\
11:36\
honestly feeling s tier but since I've\
11:38\
only had them in my rotation for about a\
11:40\
month I don't want to overhype them too\
11:42\
early so I'm going to tentatively drop\
11:44\
them back to a tier for now you may be\

\f1\b Cheat Curl
\f0\b0 \
11:46\
surprised to learn that there actually\
11:47\
aren't any studies on whether or not\
11:49\
cheating or strict form causes more\
11:51\
muscle growth I'm planning to help run\
11:52\
that study soon but for now I can't see\
11:55\
the theoretical merits of both as long\
11:57\
as the cheating isn't too extreme by by\
11:59\
using a little momentum to help get the\
12:00\
weight moving you can curl up a bit more\
12:02\
load and then resist and control that\
12:05\
load on the very anabolic negative phase\
12:07\
this might surprise some of you but I\
12:09\
actually think a properly executed cheek\
12:11\
curl can be great for biceps growth and\
12:13\
can also teach some people who might be\
12:15\
more uptight and rigid with their form\
12:17\
how to push themselves hard I definitely\
12:19\
don't think I'd recommend them for\
12:20\
beginners but as an experienced trainee\
12:23\
as long as you can control the negative\
12:24\
and keep the cheating under control I'd\
12:26\
put them in the bottom of a tier the\
12:28\
strict curl is at the opposite end of\

\f1\b Strict Curl
\f0\b0 \
12:30\
the spectrum here you maintain very\
12:32\
strict technique by bracing against a\
12:34\
wall with three points of contact your\
12:36\
glutes your upper back and your head the\
12:39\
theoretical upside here is that you\
12:40\
direct all the tension coming from the\
12:42\
bar into your biceps unlike with the\
12:44\
cheek curl there's no tension being lost\
12:46\
to your hips or your low back with stri\
12:48\
curls if you're lifting more weight or\
12:49\
doing more reps your biceps are getting\
12:52\
stronger and they're most likely getting\
12:54\
bigger too I suspect strict curls would\
12:56\
be a bit better than cheet curls but\
12:58\
without that study it's hard to know for\
13:00\
sure and honestly I could see it going\
13:02\
either way so I'm going to leave strict\
13:03\
curls in a tier for now as well now\

\f1\b Hammer Curl
\f0\b0 \
13:06\
hammer curls are really interesting by\
13:08\
taking a neutral grip and pointing your\
13:10\
thumb up you take your biceps out of\
13:12\
supination this means the biceps\
13:14\
probably will be less active on hammer\
13:16\
curls than on standard curls however\
13:19\
remember there's this other big muscle\
13:22\
that sits directly underneath the biceps\
13:24\
called the brachialis and the brachialis\
13:27\
will be very active on hammer curls\
13:29\
that's because all it does is bend the\
13:31\
elbow it can't contribute to subnation\
13:34\
at all so by performing hammer curls you\
13:36\
might shift some tension away from the\
13:38\
biceps and toward the brachialis and\
13:41\
since the brachialis can push the biceps\
13:43\
up more that should enhance the\
13:45\
appearance of bicep peak and because of\
13:47\
their ability to smash the brachialis I\
13:50\
think I would consider them my number\
13:51\
one movement for biceps Peak now\
13:54\
obviously you can't change the genetic\
13:56\
structure of your biceps and there's\
13:57\
honestly no hard science on this but it\
14:00\
does make sense to me that as you grow\
14:02\
your brachialis bigger the shape of your\
14:04\
bicep should become more pequ even if\
14:06\
just a little of course dumbbell hammer\
14:08\
curls have the same tension issue as all\
14:09\
the free weight standing curls so\
14:11\
they're not quite good enough to get\
14:13\
into s tier but they definitely do\

\f1\b Preacher Hammer Curl
\f0\b0 \
14:15\
belong in a tier that said if you do\
14:17\
your hammer curls while braced against a\
14:18\
preacher bench you instantly improve the\
14:20\
resistance profile and so hammer grip\
14:23\
creature curls are going in s tier\

\f1\b Inverse Zottman Curl
\f0\b0 \
14:25\
inverse zman curls are where you do a\
14:27\
hammer curl on the positive and then a\
14:29\
standard supinated curl on the negative\
14:32\
this means you get the advantage of\
14:33\
hammer curls on the positive for the\
14:35\
break Alis and the advantage of\
14:36\
supinated curls on the negative for the\
14:38\
biceps these also can help overload the\
14:40\
biceps on the negative with a bit more\
14:42\
load since you're generally able to curl\
14:44\
more weight up with a hammer grip and\
14:46\
since your biceps are stronger on the\
14:47\
negative I think that's a smart pairing\
14:49\
inverse s and curls are going in high a\
14:51\
tier and if I had to pick just one\
14:53\
exercise as the best of the best it'd\
14:55\
have to be the face away beian cable\
14:58\
curl I think the 40 45\'b0 preacher curl\
15:00\
would be a very close second and I think\
15:01\
they should both be in your biceps\
15:03\
routine and the worst of the worst would\
15:05\
have to be the waiter curl also I want\

\f1\b The Muscle Ladder Book
\f0\b0 \
15:07\
to give you guys a quick update on my\
15:08\
new book I'm going to send everyone who\
15:10\
pre-orders the muscle ladder a free\
15:12\
ebook called the ultimate exercise guide\
15:14\
which covers my best exercise for every\
15:16\
muscle it covers the muscles that I\
15:18\
haven't covered in this series like the\
15:19\
forearms glutes and calves it also\
15:21\
includes a more depth than I'm able to\
15:23\
give in these videos to get the free\
15:25\
ebook all you need to do is pre-order\
15:27\
the muscle ladder on Amazon Burns a\
15:29\
noble or wherever you buy your books and\
15:31\
then show me your order number to do\
15:33\
that just go to Jeff ner.me\
15:59\
you the free ebook to your email as well\
16:00\
all you have to do is go to Jeff\
16:11\
ner.me versus cheating technique I'll\
16:14\
definitely do a video on that once the\
16:15\
the study is up and running um don't\

\f1\b \cf0 What makes a shoulder exercise great?
\f0\b0 \
0:00\
what are the best and worst shoulder\
0:01\
exercises for muscle growth well in this\
0:04\
video I'll be ranking the most popular\
0:05\
movements on a tier list from s for\
0:08\
super to F for fail and at the end I'll\
0:11\
Crown one exercise as the best of the\
0:13\
best raising it to S tier plus and I'll\
0:16\
pick one exercise as the worst of the\
0:18\
worst for a shoulder exercise to get\
0:19\
into s tier it needs to provide high\
0:22\
tension especially in the stretched\
0:24\
position it needs to feel good which\
0:26\
means it doesn't cause shoulder pain and\
0:28\
it has a smooth resistance profile and\
0:30\
it needs to have a simple progression if\
0:32\
you can't add weight or reps over time\
0:34\
I'm knocking it down the deltoids have\
0:36\
three main heads the anterior or front\
0:38\
head which raises the arm up to the\
0:40\
front the lateral or side head which\
0:42\
lifts the arm out to the side and the\
0:44\
posterior or rear head which pulls the\
0:46\
arm back because these heads can be\
0:48\
thought of as almost separate muscles\
0:50\
I'm going to reveal my number one\
0:51\
exercise for each head as we go hidden\
0:54\
behind these three doors and right\
0:56\
before we get into it I'm stoked to\
0:58\
announce that my first published hard\
1:00\
copy book is officially available for\
1:02\
pre-order it's called the muscle ladder\
1:05\
and it has 15 chapters with each chapter\
1:07\
representing a different rung on the\
1:09\
ladder the book covers everything\
1:10\
training related and I also included a\
1:12\
full chapter on nutrition and\
1:14\
supplements plus a huge chapter on\
1:16\
training technique with demos for every\
1:19\
fundamental exercise and I'm also\
1:20\
including 20 free programs for every\
1:23\
experience level in the book I went with\
1:24\
a traditional publisher because I wanted\
1:26\
the book to be as high quality as\
1:27\
humanly possible and you can pre-order\
1:29\
it or wherever you buy books and lock in\
1:31\
the best price guarantee I'll put a link\
1:33\
to that in the description box down\
1:34\
below okay let's start with the most\
1:36\
popular shoulder exercise you'll see in\
1:38\
gyms all across the globe every day the\

\f1\b Standing Dumbbell Lateral Raise
\f0\b0 \
1:40\
standing dumbbell lateral Rays now\
1:42\
because the side belts are more\
1:44\
important for developing an x-frame\
1:46\
physique with a tapered look you'll\
1:47\
probably notice that I do slightly favor\
1:49\
exercises that Target the side delts\
1:51\
over exercises that Target the front\
1:53\
delts and that's because your front\
1:55\
delts already get hit with any chest\
1:57\
work in your program and they're usually\
1:59\
over veloped relative to the side and\
2:01\
rear heads I like the dumbbell lateral\
2:03\
Rays because it's super simple and you\
2:05\
can get them done quickly you can grab a\
2:07\
pair of dumbbells a lot faster than you\
2:08\
can set up a cable especially if you do\
2:10\
cables one arm at a time so I do think\
2:12\
they are the most time efficient\
2:14\
shoulder exercise but I don't think\
2:15\
they're the most effective shoulder\
2:17\
exercise that's because you have zero\
2:19\
tension on your side delts at the bottom\
2:21\
when they're the most stretched and you\
2:22\
don't reach Peak tension until your arms\
2:24\
are at 90\'b0 when the delts are most\
2:26\
shortened but despite this limitation\
2:28\
they'll still clearly grow your\
2:29\
shoulders this has been proven by real\
2:30\
world examples of bodybuilders who built\
2:32\
huge side delts from dumbbell laterals\
2:34\
and I still do these myself whenever I'm\
2:36\
pressed for time but because of the\
2:38\
slightly suboptimal tension curve I'm\
2:40\
putting these in B tier however if you\
2:42\
lean against something like a bench or a\

\f1\b Lean-In Dumbbell Lateral Raise
\f0\b0 \
2:44\
rack you suddenly modify the resistance\
2:46\
curve to place more tension on your side\
2:48\
delt when it's most stretched I think\
2:51\
that this is the most effective way to\
2:52\
do lateral raises with dumbbells the\
2:54\
lean in dumbbell lateral raise is going\
2:57\
in a tier leaning away might shift some\

\f1\b Lean-Away Dumbbell Lateral Raise
\f0\b0 \
2:59\
some emphasis away from the muscles of\
3:01\
the rotator cuff and onto the lateral\
3:03\
delt depending on how you interpret this\
3:05\
study but it still has the issue of not\
3:06\
placing high enough tension in the\
3:08\
stretched position so I'm putting these\
3:10\
in B tier as well okay here's a spicy\
3:12\
one the super ROM lateral Rays I picked\

\f1\b Super ROM Lateral Raise
\f0\b0 \
3:15\
these up from Dr Mike isrel when we\
3:17\
trained shoulders together and man they\
3:19\
definitely lit my delts up I think this\
3:21\
is a very rare movement where you\
3:22\
actually get the side delt fully\
3:24\
contracted I like that and even though\
3:26\
the trend of the current evidence is\
3:28\
converging on the stretch being more\
3:29\
important than the squeeze there's\
3:31\
actually very little direct evidence on\
3:33\
the shoulders about this so I think\
3:35\
these are worth trying that said because\
3:37\
they have the same resistance curve\
3:38\
issues as the standard dumbbell lateral\
3:40\
rays are not quite good enough to get\
3:41\
into a tier I'm putting the super ROM\
3:43\
lateral rays in B tier I'll get to\
3:45\
cables in a second but first I want to\
3:47\
get the most controversial one out of\
3:49\
the way all right people who like the\

\f1\b Overhead Press
\f0\b0 \
3:50\
overhead press really like the overhead\
3:52\
press and I can see why a strong OHP is\
3:55\
one of the most impressive Feats of\
3:57\
Strength that you'll see in the gym\
3:59\
actually I'd say out of all the barbell\
4:00\
lifts I'm more impressed by a big\
4:02\
overhead press than I am by a big squat\
4:04\
a big bench or a big deadlift but the\
4:07\
question is how effective is the\
4:09\
exercise for building 3D delts well\
4:12\
let's see it does provide high tension\
4:14\
on the shoulders in the stretch position\
4:15\
you can overload it extremely well even\
4:18\
though the lift tends to be a stubborn\
4:19\
lift you can usually add a little weight\
4:21\
or a rep or at least improve your\
4:23\
Technique in some way and I think that\
4:24\
once you nail the technique down it's a\
4:26\
very gratifying lift so that's all\
4:28\
awesome however it does have two\
4:30\
downsides for one it's very anterior\
4:33\
delt dominant when we look at activation\
4:35\
patterns across the delt heads you see\
4:37\
that the side and rear heads aren't\
4:38\
activated much with the overhead press\
4:40\
and for two because you're standing it's\
4:42\
not the most stable this means your\
4:44\
lower body and your core will have to\
4:45\
work to keep your balance which will\
4:47\
shift some tension coming from the bar\
4:49\
away from your shoulders that's not a\
4:51\
deal breaker but it's probably not ideal\
4:53\
from a bodybuilding standpoint so all\
4:55\
things considered I think I like the\
4:56\
barbell overhead press more than a lot\
4:58\
of science-based hypertrophy heads but I\
5:00\
think I like it less than some\
5:02\
powerbuilding purists I'm putting it in\
5:04\
B tier plus I think it's overhated from\
5:07\
the science crowd and I think it's\
5:08\
overrated from the barbell crowd now if\
5:10\
you do them seated you do fix the\

\f1\b Seated Overhead Press
\f0\b0 \
5:12\
stability issue since you no longer have\
5:13\
to worry about your balance but since\
5:15\
they're still very front Del dominant\
5:17\
and there's something about the seated\
5:19\
op that just isn't as satisfying as the\
5:21\
standing op I'm going to leave these in\
5:23\
B tier as well if you switch the barbell\

\f1\b Dumbbell Overhead Press
\f0\b0 \
5:25\
out for dumbbells I think a few things\
5:27\
improve for one you can get your sets\
5:29\
done faster you can grab a pair of\
5:30\
dumbbells a lot faster than you can set\
5:32\
up a barbell for two you can get a bit\
5:34\
more range of motion at both the bottom\
5:35\
and at the top especially if you allow\
5:37\
the dumbbells to converge and three I\
5:40\
think you'll get a little more side delt\
5:41\
involvement with dumbbells because they\
5:43\
have to activate to keep the dumbbells\
5:44\
from falling forward or backward and so\
5:47\
I'm going to put these in a tier the\

\f1\b Machine Shoulder Press
\f0\b0 \
5:49\
machine shoulder press is a personal\
5:51\
favorite if you can find a good machine\
5:53\
that gets your delts into a deep stretch\
5:55\
I do find that it feels better than\
5:56\
dumbbells and also since it's less\
5:59\
dependent on technique and coordination\
6:01\
you can get your delts all the way to\
6:02\
failure without losing control of the\
6:04\
weight it's still going to be very front\
6:05\
delt dominant but as a vertical pressing\
6:07\
option for hypertrophy this is usually\
6:09\
my go-to these days it's going in a tier\
6:12\
plus and it's also my number one\
6:14\
exercise for the front delts making it\
6:16\
our first reveal behind door number one\
6:18\
if you don't have a good shoulder press\
6:19\
machine my next go-to would be the\
6:21\
seated dumbbell shoulder press all right\

\f1\b \'91Arnold Style\'92 Side Lying Dumbbell Raise
\f0\b0 \
6:22\
this is a cool exercise you may have\
6:24\
seen recently on Arnold's Instagram I'll\
6:26\
call it the ernold style Sid Ling\
6:28\
dumbbell rise it looks a bit odd but I\
6:30\
actually really like it unlike a\
6:32\
standing dumbbell lateral raise you get\
6:34\
high tension while you're Delta\
6:35\
stretched and because you're locked in\
6:37\
against a bench you'll be nice and\
6:39\
stable you'll get a huge range of motion\
6:41\
and you should get a great side delt\
6:42\
pump here I'm putting these in a tier\

\f1\b Front Raises
\f0\b0 \
6:45\
for the record front raises of any kind\
6:47\
so dumbbell cable or machine are all\
6:50\
going in D tier I think that if you have\
6:52\
any pressing in your program your front\
6:54\
delts are already getting more than\
6:55\
enough work so they don't need any extra\
6:57\
isolation that said if you're one of the\
6:59\
rare few with underdeveloped anterior\
7:01\
delts or if you can't do presses for\
7:03\
whatever reason these will be your go-to\
7:05\
the Atlantis standing machine lateral\

\f1\b Atlantis Standing Machine Lateral Raise
\f0\b0 \
7:07\
Rays is amazing because it feels so\
7:09\
smooth and you get this even consistent\
7:11\
tension on the side delts throughout the\
7:13\
range of motion it's easy to add a\
7:14\
little weight or a rep from week to week\
7:16\
and since I've been using it I've\
7:18\
actually gotten so much stronger with it\
7:19\
that I'm getting pretty close to maxing\
7:21\
out the weight stack the only minor snag\
7:22\
is that since you can't move your arms\
7:24\
across your body you won't get quite as\
7:25\
good of a stretch as you will with\
7:27\
cables or even with the Arnold lying\
7:29\
raay so it's very close to S tier but\
7:31\
I'm going to tentatively knock it back\
7:33\
to a tier plus because of the overload\
7:35\
in the feel it's still an exercise that\
7:37\
I do every week though the seated\

\f1\b Seated Machine Lateral Raise
\f0\b0 \
7:38\
machine lateral raise is similar and I\
7:40\
include it as well but for whatever\
7:42\
reason having the pads higher up on my\
7:44\
arms doesn't feel quite as good that\
7:45\
might be because the moment arm to the\
7:47\
shoulder is so short that I have to load\
7:49\
it with more weight and that actually\
7:50\
cranks my shoulders a bit I still like\
7:52\
these but I think they're in between a\
7:53\
tier and B tier I'll be picky and say B\
7:56\
tier all right the cable lateral raise\

\f1\b Cable Lateral Raise
\f0\b0 \
7:58\
is incredible because as long as you set\
8:00\
the cable at around hand height it'll\
8:02\
provide maximum tension on the side delt\
8:05\
while it's most stretched that's because\
8:06\
you get the highest tension whenever\
8:08\
your arm and the cable form a 90\'b0 angle\
8:11\
perhaps more importantly though I find\
8:13\
that cable lateral raise just feels\
8:15\
excellent you get that nice even tension\
8:17\
on your side delts throughout the range\
8:19\
of motion I personally find I can\
8:20\
connect with my side delts even better\
8:22\
if I use wrist cuffs that's because even\
8:24\
though my grip won't be a limiting\
8:26\
factor here my forearms still get a big\
8:28\
pump and that takes away some of my\
8:30\
focus from my delts but then if I just\
8:32\
have a floating hand with nothing to\
8:33\
hold on to it feels a bit awkward so I\
8:35\
hold on to a lacrosse ball with the cuff\
8:37\
this might be too gimmicky for some of\
8:39\
you but I love them you really can't go\
8:41\
wrong with a cable lateral raise whether\
8:42\
you do them with a standard D handle or\
8:44\
with cuffs and that's why they're going\
8:46\
straight to S tier in fact I would say\
8:48\
this is my favorite side Delta exercise\
8:49\
of all making it the second reveal\
8:51\
behind door number two the cable y raise\

\f1\b Cable Y-Raise
\f0\b0 \
8:54\
actually gives you an even bigger range\
8:56\
of motion where you sweep the cable up\
8:58\
and out and back back and it's also\
9:00\
going in s tier the only reason it isn't\
9:02\
my number one pick is that some people\
9:04\
do find them a little more Awkward to\
9:05\
learn the behind the back cuffed lateral\

\f1\b Behind-The-Back Cuffed Lateral Raise
\f0\b0 \
9:07\
raise is the most gimmicky looking\
9:09\
exercise that I actually do but I think\
9:11\
it's amazing its main advantage over the\
9:13\
standard cable lateral raise is that you\
9:15\
get to knock out both arms at once which\
9:17\
is twice as time efficient to set it up\
9:19\
just hook your wrists into the Cuffs\
9:21\
optionally grab a pair of lacrosse balls\
9:23\
and step over one of the cables while\
9:25\
spinning around and crossing the cables\
9:27\
over behind your back then step for for\
9:29\
Ward and raise the cables out and\
9:31\
slightly forward who cares what it looks\
9:33\
like if it works it works these are\
9:35\
going in s tier the banded lateral raise\

\f1\b Banded Lateral Raise
\f0\b0 \
9:38\
is my least favorite lateral raise\
9:40\
option and I rarely include it these\
9:41\
days similar to the dumbbell lateral\
9:43\
raise it provides zero tension in the\
9:45\
stretch and maximum tension at the top\
9:48\
unless all you have is a band I do think\
9:50\
dumbbells cables or machine laterals\
9:52\
would be a better choice these are going\
9:54\
in C tier the upright row is definitely\

\f1\b Upright Row
\f0\b0 \
9:56\
an overhated exercise it's going to\
9:59\
Target both the upper traps and the side\
10:01\
delts with a little bit of biceps\
10:03\
involvement I prefer to do these on\
10:04\
cables with a rope because I can sweep\
10:06\
the handles out as I row as long as you\
10:08\
have healthy shoulders there's no\
10:10\
evidence that they contribute to\
10:11\
shoulder issues I'm going to put these\
10:13\
in B tier as a delt Builder they don't\
10:15\
rank higher because even with the cables\
10:17\
the upper traps will start to take over\
10:19\
so it's hard to get the delt fibers to\
10:21\
True exhaustion they're still a great\
10:22\
overall Yol Builder though and I am a\
10:25\
fan of upright rows the reverse pec deck\

\f1\b Reverse Pec Deck
\f0\b0 \
10:27\
is an amazing rear Delta exercise it\
10:29\
provides consistent tension throughout\
10:31\
the range of motion and because your\
10:33\
chest is braced you'll be directing all\
10:35\
that tension coming from the stack into\
10:37\
your rear delts I actually prefer to do\
10:39\
these sitting sideways because you'll\
10:40\
get a much deeper stretch the downside\
10:43\
is that you'll need to do each arm one\
10:44\
at a time that means it'll take a bit\
10:46\
longer you can superet each arm though\
10:49\
so while one side is working the other\
10:50\
side is resting and you can just go back\
10:52\
and forth without much rest in between\
10:54\
my instinct is to put these in a tier\
10:56\
but I think if you can lock in that\
10:57\
sideways position they deserve to be in\
11:00\
s tier the Rope face pull will Target\

\f1\b Rope Facepull
\f0\b0 \
11:02\
the rear delts really well especially if\
11:04\
you set up the Rope a little lower take\
11:06\
an underhand grip and externally rotate\
11:09\
your shoulders as you pull kind of like\
11:11\
doing a rear double biceps pose my minor\
11:13\
gripe though is that it's just really\
11:14\
hard to get your mid traps to not take\
11:16\
over no matter what cues you use your\
11:18\
mid traps are going to be active that's\
11:20\
not necessarily a bad thing because you\
11:22\
do want your mid back to grow as well\
11:24\
but then your rear delts might not be\
11:26\
the limiting factor still think it's a\
11:27\
great exercise to include since it'll\
11:29\
give a big stretch on the rear delts\
11:31\
they feel good and they're solid for\
11:32\
overload rope face pulls are going in a\
11:35\
tier for rear delt growth bent over\

\f1\b Bent Over Reverse Dumbbell Flye
\f0\b0 \
11:37\
reverse dumbbell flies have the same\
11:39\
problem as dumbbell lateral raises zero\
11:41\
tension at the bottom when the delts are\
11:43\
stretched I still think they're a good\
11:44\
option if you don't have access to\
11:45\
cables or if you're really time\
11:46\
constrained I actually still do them\
11:48\
myself when I'm in a hurry oddly enough\
11:50\
my rear adults always get really sore\
11:51\
from these too they'd probably be in a\
11:53\
tier but because there's not quite\
11:55\
enough tension in the stretch I've got\
11:56\
to knock them back to B tier all right\

\f1\b Reverse Cable Crossover
\f0\b0 \
11:58\
the reverse cable crossover amazing\
12:01\
stretch on your rear delts especially if\
12:03\
you cross your arms over at the top\
12:04\
enormous range of motion with nice even\
12:07\
tension throughout the range as long as\
12:08\
you hold the cables themselves and not\
12:10\
the handles it should feel nice and\
12:12\
smooth and you shouldn't run into any\
12:14\
clanging as your arms cross over and\
12:16\
then to avoid any left to right muscle\
12:17\
imbalances you can Alternate which arm\
12:19\
you cross over on top from set to set as\
12:22\
long as you focus on sweeping the cables\
12:24\
out rather than yanking them back you\
12:25\
should feel a massive connection with\
12:27\
your rear delts these are amazing and\
12:29\
they're easily going into s tier and\
12:31\
that also makes them the third reveal\
12:33\
behind door number three as my number\
12:35\
one rear delt Builder and if out of all\
12:38\
these I had to pick one exercise as the\
12:39\
worst of the worst I guess I'd have to\
12:41\
be the front raise not because it's so\
12:43\
bad for muscle growth but rather because\
12:44\
I think it's redundant in most cases\
12:46\
still not bad enough to get into F tier\
12:48\
though because I do think it can have\
12:49\
its place and if I had to pick one\
12:51\
exercise as the best of the best for\
12:52\
overall shoulder development I think I'd\
12:54\
go with the cable lateral raise it's\
12:57\
easy to do it's super effective and\
12:59\
takes all the boxes for hypertrophy now\
13:01\
do you know the best and worst quad\
13:03\
exercises for muscle growth if not you\
13:05\

\pard\pardeftab560\slleading20\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf0 What makes a quad exercise great?
\f0\b0 \
0:00\
what are the best and worst quad\
0:01\
exercises for muscle growth well in this\
0:03\
video I'll be ranking 20 of the most\
0:05\
popular movements on a tier list from s\
0:08\
for super to F for fail and at the end\
0:11\
I'll Crown one exercise as the best of\
0:13\
the best and one as the worst of the\
0:15\
worst and for a quad exercise to get\
0:17\
into s tier it needs to tick three boxes\
0:20\
first High quad tension especially in\
0:23\
the stretched position second it needs\
0:25\
to feel good that means it doesn't cause\
0:27\
knee pain and it has a smooth resistance\
0:29\
profile third it needs to have a simple\
0:31\
progression that means you can apply\
0:33\
Progressive overload by either adding\
0:35\
some weight or a rep from week to week\
0:37\
now as I'm sure you all know there are\
0:39\
four heads of the quadriceps hence the\
0:41\
quad prefects actually one recent\
0:43\
Anatomy paper suggested that there could\
0:45\
be a fifth head but if it does exist in\
0:47\
some of us I don't think it changes\
0:48\
anything training wise the foreheads are\
0:50\
the vastest medialis also known as the\
0:52\
teardrop muscle on the inside the\
0:55\
vastest intermedius which runs down the\
0:57\
middle the vastest lateralis on the\
0:59\
outside and finally there's the rectus\
1:01\
femoris which is a long flat head that\
1:03\
also runs down the middle on top of the\
1:06\
other heads all four heads contract to\
1:08\
perform knee extension which is when you\
1:10\
straighten your knee out so every\
1:11\
exercise we cover performs knee\
1:13\
extension however one head that long\
1:16\
flat rectus femoris has a second\
1:18\
function it also performs something\
1:20\
called hip flexion which is when you\
1:21\
raise your leg up to the front keep this\
1:23\
in mind for later all right let's get\
1:25\
the worst out of the way so you guys\
1:26\
don't waste any time on them let's see\

\f1\b Combo Squat Exercises
\f0\b0 \
1:28\
squat combination exercises like the the\
1:30\
squat plus press and the lunge plus curl\
1:32\
are going straight to F tier that's\
1:34\
because your quads are way stronger than\
1:35\
your shoulders or your arms so your\
1:37\
upper body is always going to fatigue\
1:39\
well before your quads bosu ball squats\
1:41\
are so bad I didn't even film them the\

\f1\b Bosu Ball Squat
\f0\b0 \
1:43\
problem is because they're so unstable\
1:45\
your ankle ends up doing a lot of the\
1:46\
stabilization work and that severely\
1:48\
limits the amount of tension that your\
1:50\
quads receive they might have some\
1:51\
utility in some athletic contexts but\
1:53\
for building muscle bosu ball squats are\
1:56\
going straight to F tier all right so\
1:57\
what about the most popular quad\
1:59\
exercise of all time the barbell back\

\f1\b Barbell Back Squat
\f0\b0 \
2:01\
squat well let's see it offers high\
2:04\
tension on the quads deep in the hole\
2:06\
when they're most stretched they should\
2:07\
feel good especially once you lock in\
2:09\
your bar path and they might be one of\
2:10\
the best exercises for Progressive\
2:12\
overload period you can always add a\
2:14\
little weight or a rep each week as you\
2:16\
gain size and strength now because it's\
2:17\
a free weight squat your spinal Erectors\
2:19\
will have to do some stabilization but\
2:21\
that's not a deal breaker in my opinion\
2:23\
your quads are still the prime movers\
2:25\
and if you need any proof that squats\
2:26\
can build some monster quads just go to\
2:28\
a powerlifting meat all the biggest\
2:30\
squatters will have some massive quads\
2:32\
and I don't think I've ever seen an\
2:33\
exception to that now some Anatomy\
2:35\
enjoyers will point out that the rectus\
2:37\
fous head is not maximally activated by\
2:39\
the squat because unlike the other three\
2:41\
heads it's shortening at the knee while\
2:44\
lengthening at the hip this is true\
2:46\
however studies still show pretty solid\
2:48\
rectus femoris growth with squats and as\
2:50\
long as you include one other exercise\
2:52\
in your program that will get to this\
2:54\
concern completely goes away so while\
2:56\
the mild Anatomy concern almost pulls it\
2:58\
back to a tier I just can't take the\
3:00\
barbell back squat out of s tier without\
3:02\
a guilty conscience the barbell front\

\f1\b Barbell Front Squat
\f0\b0 \
3:04\
squat has all the same upsides of the\
3:06\
barbell back squat except it actually\
3:08\
shifts even more tension to the quads\
3:10\
that's because where the barbell Center\
3:11\
of mass is shifted forward in front of\
3:13\
your neck you're forced to keep a more\
3:15\
upright posture so you don't fall over\
3:17\
this increases the moment arm to the\
3:19\
knee joint placing more tension on the\
3:21\
quads that said the forward bar Position\
3:23\
will also force your upper back to work\
3:25\
harder and some coaches argue that this\
3:27\
causes your upper back to become the\
3:28\
limiting factor I don't fully agree\
3:30\
unless you're going super heavy you\
3:32\
really should be able to keep your\
3:33\
elbows up and you should be able to get\
3:35\
your quads close to failure without your\
3:37\
back giving out first now front squats\
3:38\
will lose a few points in the feels good\
3:40\
department for some of you but remember\
3:42\
that for bodybuilding you can use the\
3:44\
two-finger grip the crossed arm grip or\
3:46\
the strap grip whatever feels best from\
3:49\
there just focus on keeping your elbows\
3:50\
up squatting down between your legs and\
3:52\
standing back up with a tall chest I'm\
3:54\
going to put these in a tier because\
3:56\
despite activating the quads a bit more\
3:58\
I find enough people just hate doing\
4:00\
them or find the bar position awkward\
4:02\
and I don't think there's enough of a\
4:03\
tension shift to Trump that if you can\
4:05\
do them comfortably though I'd have no\
4:06\
problem if you bump them up to S tier\

\f1\b Low-Bar Squat
\f0\b0 \
4:08\
Okay so we've covered a high bar back\
4:09\
squat in a front squat what about a low\
4:12\
bar back squat for a low bar squat you\
4:14\
shift the barbell Down 2 or 3 in so it\
4:17\
sits on your rear delts instead of your\
4:18\
upper traps and research shows that\
4:20\
while this technique will allow you to\
4:22\
load more total weight it actually\
4:23\
shifts some of the tension away from\
4:25\
your quads and onto your glutes this\
4:27\
isn't a complete deal breaker though\
4:29\
because you you still see extremely high\
4:30\
quad activity as long as you're\
4:32\
squatting to a reasonable depth low\
4:33\
breath squats are going in a tier as\
4:35\
well the hack squat is a longtime\

\f1\b Hack Squat
\f0\b0 \
4:37\
bodybuilding staple and it ticks all the\
4:38\
same boxes as the barbell squat plus it\
4:41\
has a few extra benefits you can\
4:42\
generally get your sets done a bit\
4:43\
faster because there's less setup you'll\
4:45\
be a bit more locked in meaning less\
4:47\
stabilization work and potentially more\
4:49\
direct quad tension and you can play\
4:51\
with your foot position to find a\
4:52\
comfortable spot without worrying about\
4:54\
your balance contrary to popular belief\
4:56\
the latest science shows that on average\
4:58\
free weights and machines can both build\
5:00\
muscle roughly equally as long as you're\
5:02\
pushing your sets hard this is truly a\
5:04\
brilliant quad Builder and it's\
5:06\
obviously going an S TI the pendulum\

\f1\b Pendulum Squat
\f0\b0 \
5:08\
squat is similar to the hack squat\
5:09\
except the weight moves up and down in\
5:11\
an arc I actually find this resistance\
5:13\
path feels more natural than the linear\
5:15\
hack squat so these movements just keep\
5:17\
getting better and better that said most\
5:19\
gyms don't have a pendulum squat so not\
5:21\
everyone will be able to do it I still\
5:22\
think it belongs in s tier though all\
5:24\
right last squat type movement for now\

\f1\b Smith Machine Squat
\f0\b0 \
5:26\
the Smith machine squat seems to be a\
5:28\
bit more accepted now than it was for or\
5:29\
5 years ago especially as more top\
5:31\
bodybuilders gravitate to it I think the\
5:33\
best thing about the Smith machine is\
5:34\
that you can actually push your quads\
5:36\
close to or to failure without that same\
5:38\
fear of falling over or needing to dump\
5:40\
the bar and other than potentially redu\
5:42\
stabilizer involvement it really is the\
5:44\
same basic movement pattern as the free\
5:45\
weight barbell Squat and so for\
5:47\
hypertrophy it also has to go in s tier\

\f1\b 45 Degree Leg Press
\f0\b0 \
5:50\
all right let's move on to the 45\'b0 leg\
5:52\
press since you're also flexing and\
5:54\
extending the knee the quads will of\
5:55\
course receive high tension however I do\
5:58\
find that a lot of leg presses don't\
5:59\
allow me to get as deep as I can get on\
6:01\
a squat again as far as hypertrophy is\
6:03\
concerned the deeper you can get the\
6:05\
better so if you're not able to get your\
6:07\
calves cheer glutes you might not be\
6:09\
getting as much out of a leg press as\
6:10\
you would out of a deep squat outside of\
6:12\
that though leg presses do generally\
6:14\
feel good and they are good for overload\
6:16\
I'm going to put them in a tier now the\

\f1\b Horizontal Leg Press
\f0\b0 \
6:18\
horizontal leg press is worse in my\
6:20\
opinion because they almost always have\
6:22\
even more limited range of motion so\
6:24\
it'll be harder to get high tension in\
6:26\
the Deep stretch and once your legs get\
6:28\
decently strong you'll probably max out\
6:30\
the machine which means overload is\
6:32\
going to be more limited for\
6:33\
intermediate to Advanced lifters the\
6:35\
horizontal leg press is going in C tier\
6:37\
the lunge is a better glute Builder than\

\f1\b Lunge
\f0\b0 \
6:39\
it is a quad builder in my experience\
6:41\
even though it will grow both you get\
6:43\
some stretch and some tension on the\
6:44\
quads but not as much as you get on the\
6:46\
glutes they do feel good but if you're\
6:48\
doing them right you should feel your\
6:50\
glutes more than your quads you can get\
6:52\
the quads more involved by taking more\
6:53\
shallow steps and there's nothing wrong\
6:55\
with that but I think they're best\
6:56\
utilized and best thought of as a glute\
6:58\
Builder as a quad exercise they're going\
7:00\
in B tier but I'd say they'd probably be\
7:03\
a or S tier for glute growth all right\

\f1\b Leg Extension
\f0\b0 \
7:05\
the leg extension this is a surprisingly\
7:07\
controversial one some people say that\
7:09\
they're bad for your knees but this has\
7:10\
been thoroughly debunked now if you have\
7:12\
bad knees or they give you knee pain you\
7:14\
should go easy on them but there's no\
7:16\
convincing evidence that they cause knee\
7:18\
issues any more than any other quad\
7:20\
exercise but the great thing about the\
7:21\
leg extension is that your hips are\
7:23\
fixed this means that unlike squat based\
7:26\
exercises your rectus femoris will\
7:28\
actually stretch and contract here this\
7:30\
makes it the first exercise where all\
7:31\
four heads of the quads will be highly\
7:33\
engaged this is even more the case if\
7:35\
you set the seat back in fact a brand\
7:37\
new study found significantly more\
7:39\
overall quad growth and especially more\
7:40\
rectus fous growth with the seat back\
7:43\
leg extension position that's most\
7:44\
likely because it places the rectus Fus\
7:46\
under more stretch or it at least trains\
7:48\
it at a longer muscle length assuming\
7:50\
you're leaning back and you've got a\
7:51\
machine that stretches your quads well I\
7:53\
think they're good enough to get into a\
7:55\
tier they don't have quite the same\
7:56\
overload potential as squats do and even\
7:58\
though some studies do show similar leg\
8:00\
growth between leg extensions and squats\
8:02\
those are short-term studies and I'm\
8:03\
just frankly doubtful that doing leg\
8:05\
extensions will net you the same quad\
8:07\
gains as doing squats over the long term\
8:09\
that said they're still a staple on my\
8:10\
leg days and they're an exercise I\
8:12\
definitely think is worth including all\
8:13\
right the reverse Nordic is the same\

\f1\b Reverse Nordic
\f0\b0 \
8:15\
basic movement pattern as a leg\
8:16\
extension except they have the added\
8:18\
benefit of being more accessible you\
8:20\
don't need a leg extension machine to do\
8:21\
them you can also get a much deeper\
8:23\
stretch on your quads here the slight\
8:25\
negative though is that they are really\
8:26\
tough meaning beginners might struggle\
8:28\
with them and they can be hard to\
8:29\
overload with weight so you're a bit\
8:31\
more limited on your overload options\
8:33\
you can still add a rep each week though\
8:34\
or try to get a bit deeper and because\
8:36\
the stretch is s tier on these and\
8:38\
they're so accessible I'm going to put\
8:39\
them in a tier overall but if you find\
8:42\
them really awkward I'd be cool if you\
8:43\
drop them back a tier or two all right\
8:45\
let's knock out three final squat\
8:46\
variations one that I love one that I\
8:48\
hate and one that's just okay goblet\

\f1\b Goblet Squat
\f0\b0 \
8:50\
squats are biomechanically very similar\
8:52\
to a barbell front squat so they will\
8:54\
highly activate your quads but because\
8:56\
you have to hold a dumbbell in your\
8:57\
hands they're actually a lot harder to\
8:59\
overload once your quads get decently\
9:01\
strong you'll be able to squat a lot\
9:03\
more weight than you'll be able to\
9:04\
comfortably hold so the goblet squat\
9:06\
will quickly be limited to high rep sets\
9:08\
only these days I generally only use it\
9:10\
in two contexts for teaching the squat\
9:12\
to beginners and as a high rep finisher\
9:14\
exercise these are just okay for me and\
9:16\
I'm putting them in C or B tier I guess\
9:18\
B tier since they definitely can have\
9:20\
their place jump squats will burn some\

\f1\b Jump Squat
\f0\b0 \
9:22\
calories and they aren't terrible for\
9:23\
building explosive power but as a muscle\
9:25\
builder there are just too many other\
9:27\
better options out there that'll provide\
9:29\
more more tension and more overload I'm\
9:31\
not a fan of these for hypertrophy so\
9:32\
they're going in F tier Bulgarian split\

\f1\b Bulgarian Split Squat
\f0\b0 \
9:35\
squats are brutal but they sure do work\
9:37\
you'll get a huge stretch on your quads\
9:39\
and doing each leg unilaterally can be\
9:41\
very helpful for preventing any left to\
9:43\
right muscle imbalances but because\
9:45\
they're so fatiguing and psychologically\
9:47\
challenging I usually only program two\
9:49\
sets of these per workout your quads\
9:50\
will get more sore doing these than on\
9:52\
almost any other exercise and while\
9:54\
soreness isn't a onetoone predictor of\
9:56\
hypertrophy in this case I think it is a\
9:58\
good indication that hitting the right\
9:59\
muscle I'm putting Bulgarian split\
10:01\
squats in s tier deadlifts do activate\

\f1\b Deadlift
\f0\b0 \
10:04\
the quads but not nearly as much as\
10:05\
squats do that's not surprising when you\
10:07\
look at the side view as far as the\
10:08\
quads are concerned a deadlift is\
10:10\
basically a quarter squat you'll get a\
10:11\
bit more quad involvement if you\
10:13\
deadlift with a Sumo stance but they\
10:14\
still don't hold the candle to squats\
10:16\
for Quad growth they're a much better\
10:17\
glute Builder and they're an excellent\
10:19\
overall strength Builder but for\
10:20\
quadriceps and muscle growth deadlifts\
10:23\
are going in C tier step-ups are equally\

\f1\b Step Ups
\f0\b0 \
10:25\
not fun as Bulgarian split squats but\
10:27\
also less effective because you get less\
10:29\
quad stretch and they're less stable\
10:31\
they do offer a pretty solid glute\
10:32\
stimulus though especially if you avoid\
10:34\
lifting off your back foot and they can\
10:36\
have their place but overall I'm feeling\
10:38\
C tier on these pistol squats are an\

\f1\b Pistol Squat
\f0\b0 \
10:40\
impressive movement if you can do them\
10:42\
but the lack of stability and overload\
10:43\
limitations knock them down quite a bit\
10:45\
for me if you're limited to at home\
10:47\
workouts or body weight training I think\
10:48\
they're great but assuming you have gym\
10:51\
access there are just so many better\
10:52\
options I'm going to put pistol squats\
10:54\
in C tier as a quad Builder squats\

\f1\b Sissy Squat
\f0\b0 \
10:56\
are similar to reverse nordics and that\
10:58\
they get a huge stretch on your quads\
11:00\
and don't let the name deceive you these\
11:02\
are very challenging that said they're a\
11:04\
bit harder to load so I find them mainly\
11:05\
limited to adding reps when it comes to\
11:07\
Progressive overload and I find that\
11:09\
they have more of a learning curve than\
11:10\
the other squat options people can also\
11:12\
find it awkward going up onto their toes\
11:13\
and getting their knees all the way\
11:15\
forward but if you can get the technique\
11:17\
down I do think they're probably the\
11:18\
best squat option for getting into a\
11:20\
super deep stretch on the quads so\
11:23\
despite some limitations I'm feeling A\
11:25\
or B tier on these I do find them a bit\
11:27\
awkward though so let's go with B tier\
11:29\
all right and if I had to Crown just one\
11:31\
exercise as the best of the best for\
11:32\
Quad growth I think I'd have to go with\
11:34\
a hack squat I personally find the\
11:36\
pendulum squat feels better but because\
11:38\
most gyms don't have one I'll go with a\
11:39\
hack squat the one issue with hacks is\
11:41\
that on some machines you can't get to\
11:43\
full depth without coming up solid if\
11:45\
that's the case for you try adding some\
11:46\
yoga blocks on top of your shoulders and\
11:48\
then you'll be able to get all the way\
11:49\
down and if your gym doesn't have a hack\
11:51\
squat I'd say a high bar barbell back\
11:53\
squat would be my alternate go-to as a\
11:55\
number one quad Builder and if I had to\
11:57\
pick one exercise as the worst of the\
11:58\
worst I guess it have to be the bosu\
12:00\
ball squat just get rid of the bosu ball\
12:02\
and it immediately becomes more stable\
12:04\
more safe and more effective now do you\
12:07\

\f1\b \cf0 What makes a Tricept exercise S tier?
\f0\b0 \
0:00\
what are the best and worst triceps\
0:02\
exercises for muscle growth well in this\
0:04\
video I'll be ranking 20 of the most\
0:06\
popular movements on a tier list from s\
0:08\
for super to F for fail and at the end\
0:11\
I'll Crown one exercise as the best of\
0:13\
the best and one as the worst of the\
0:15\
worst and to make sure your favorite\
0:16\
tricep exercise doesn't end up in F tier\
0:18\
it needs to take three boxes one it must\
0:21\
provide high tension especially in the\
0:24\
stretched position two it needs to feel\
0:26\
good meaning it doesn't cause pain and\
0:28\
it has a nice smooth resist resistance\
0:30\
profile three it needs to have a simple\
0:32\
progression that means you can easily\
0:34\
add some weight or a rep from week to\
0:36\
week now as I'm sure you know there are\
0:38\
three heads of the triceps hence the tri\
0:40\
prefx there's the lateral head the\
0:42\
medial head and the long head the long\
0:44\
head beefs up your triceps from the rear\
0:46\
the lateral head gives the triceps that\
0:48\
rant shape and the medial head runs down\
0:50\
the middle adding shape to the arm as a\
0:52\
whole and so when we're ranking\
0:54\
exercises we'll need to consider which\
0:55\
movements will emphasize which aspect to\
0:58\
ensure proportional development let's\

\f1\b Triceps Pressdown (Rope)
\f0\b0 \
1:00\
start with the most popular triceps\
1:01\
exercise the press down press Downs will\
1:03\
hit all three heads of the triceps but\
1:05\
probably grow the medial and lateral\
1:07\
heads a little better than the long head\
1:09\
there are three main ways people do\
1:10\
these using a rope using a bar and using\
1:13\
a reverse grip the advantage of using a\
1:14\
rope is that you can really drive the\
1:16\
handles apart at the bottom which will\
1:18\
help some people feel a harder\
1:20\
contraction in their triceps granted\
1:22\
this motion is mainly happening at the\
1:23\
wrists so I don't think it's adding a\
1:25\
whole lot of real contractile benefit to\
1:27\
the triceps it's more of a mind muscle\
1:29\
connection thing the downside of using\
1:31\
the Rope is that you just won't be able\
1:32\
to load as much tension onto the triceps\
1:35\
earlier this week I did an experiment\
1:37\
where I tested how many reps I could get\
1:38\
using the Rope versus using the bar\
1:41\
while keeping the weight in my technique\
1:43\
exactly the same I got 12 reps with the\
1:45\
rope and 16 reps with the bar that's\
1:48\
four extra reps at the same weight\
1:50\
simply by using a bar and that's because\
1:52\
the Rope attachment is far less rigid\
1:54\
and stable and so some of the tension\
1:56\
coming from the cable stack is being\
1:57\
lost through having to stabilize a loop\
2:00\
rope with your forearms and so while the\
2:02\
Rope might gain a point in the feels\
2:03\
good Department it loses a point in the\
2:05\
overload Department the Rope press down\
2:07\
is going in B tier with the bar press\

\f1\b Triceps Pressdown (Bar)
\f0\b0 \
2:09\
down the movement will feel a lot more\
2:11\
stable which will direct more attention\
2:13\
to your triceps the cable will provide\
2:15\
more or less even tension on the triceps\
2:17\
throughout the range of motion and the\
2:18\
bar should actually help you feel more\
2:20\
locked in which is a good thing and you\
2:21\
can easily overload by adding a little\
2:23\
weight or a rep from week to week the\
2:25\
bar press down is very close to being an\
2:27\
S tier but because it never actually\
2:29\
gets the tricep steps into a big stretch\
2:30\
at the top it isn't quite as good as\
2:32\
some of the other options that we'll\
2:33\
cover in a minute and for that reason\
2:35\
it's going in a tier but it's definitely\
2:37\
an exercise that I strongly recommend\
2:38\
and I do myself pretty much every single\
2:40\
week now the reverse grip press down is\

\f1\b Reverse Grip Triceps Pressdown
\f0\b0 \
2:42\
the worst of the three options in my\
2:44\
opinion that's because turning your\
2:46\
palms up won't actually change much for\
2:47\
your triceps biomechanically but it will\
2:49\
limit their strength output especially\
2:51\
if your grip becomes a limiting factor\
2:53\
in my experiment I actually only got 10\
2:55\
reps with an underhand grip making it\
2:57\
the weakest of the three options now I\
2:59\
know some people do do really feel this\
3:00\
variation hitting their triceps better\
3:02\
and that's probably because with an\
3:03\
underhand grip you can get your forearm\
3:05\
bones out of the way at the top but I\
3:07\
really doubt it's worth the reduction in\
3:08\
overload potential and so the reverse\
3:10\
grip press down is going in C tier the\

\f1\b Overhead Cable Triceps Extension
\f0\b0 \
3:13\
overhead cable triceps extension is a\
3:15\
similar movement where you're just\
3:16\
bending and extending your elbow except\
3:18\
for one crucial difference you move your\
3:20\
arms up overhead this actually makes a\
3:22\
world of difference for the long head\
3:24\
that's because the long head is the only\
3:26\
head that crosses both the elbow joint\
3:28\
and the shoulder joint so all three\
3:30\
heads of the triceps straighten the\
3:31\
elbow out but only the long head has a\
3:33\
second function it also performs\
3:36\
something called shoulder extension\
3:37\
which is when you move your arm down\
3:39\
that's exactly why you'll always feel\
3:41\
your triceps working on dumbbell\
3:42\
pullovers the lateral and medial heads\
3:44\
aren't doing anything but the long head\
3:46\
is working very hard alongside your lats\
3:48\
and your pecs to pull your arms down and\
3:50\
so because it crosses the shoulder it'll\
3:52\
be more contracted when your arm is down\
3:54\
like in a press down or in a kickback\
3:56\
and it'll be more stretched when your\
3:58\
arm is up overhead you can even try this\
4:00\
out for yourself put your arm back\
4:01\
behind your torso and you'll feel your\
4:03\
long head get rock hard and you can lift\
4:05\
your arm up overhead and you'll feel a\
4:07\
really big stretch that's exactly what\
4:09\
the overhead extension is doing it's\
4:10\
putting the long head under a much\
4:12\
bigger stretch but it's even better than\
4:13\
that because the cable also provides\
4:15\
super high tension in that stretched\
4:18\
position and I think that's why this\
4:19\
2023 study found that overhead\
4:21\
extensions caused about 40% more triceps\
4:24\
growth than press Downs getting that\
4:26\
long head into a more lengthened\
4:27\
position seems to be doing something\
4:29\
important for muscle growth the overhead\
4:31\
cable extension is our first triceps\
4:33\
exercise going in s tier now if you\

\f1\b Overhead Cable Triceps Extension (Rope)
\f0\b0 \
4:35\
switch the bar out for a rope you'll\
4:36\
still get all the benefits of training\
4:38\
the long head in a more lengthen\
4:39\
position but again the Rope will limit\
4:41\
your ability to overload the triceps to\
4:43\
some extent I don't actually think it'\
4:44\
make a huge difference over the long\
4:46\
term as long as you're pushing hard and\
4:48\
you're tracking your progress but I\
4:49\
usually still prefer the bar and so I'll\
4:51\
put the overhead cable extension with\
4:53\
the rope in a tier the katana triceps\

\f1\b Katana Cable Triceps Extension
\f0\b0 \
4:55\
extension gets its name from how you\
4:57\
draw a pair of Japanese katana swords\
4:59\
where Cross Your Arms overhead and grab\
5:01\
the opposite side's cable the best way\
5:03\
to get into this exercise is to grab\
5:04\
each side's cable with the same hand and\
5:07\
then spin around 180\'b0 while crossing\
5:09\
your arms over or you can start with the\
5:11\
cables crossed in front of you and then\
5:12\
duck underneath and step through either\
5:14\
way if you start with the cables at\
5:15\
around or just above waist height you\
5:17\
should end up with your arms in a\
5:19\
position about 30 to 40\'b0 forward\
5:21\
relative to being flared out to the\
5:23\
sides this is called the scapular plane\
5:25\
which feels really comfortable for a lot\
5:27\
of people these also have the rare\
5:28\
benefit of hitting both arms\
5:30\
individually while still saving on time\
5:32\
by getting both sides done at once so\
5:34\
that can be great for addressing any\
5:35\
left right imbalances while still not\
5:37\
taking twice as long these are\
5:38\
definitely a personal favorite and I'd\
5:40\
probably put them in s tier but because\
5:42\
they require a bit more setup and they\
5:43\
can have a bit of a learning curve I'm\
5:45\
going to go ahead and tentatively drop\
5:46\
them back to a tier the dumbbell French\

\f1\b Dumbbell French Press
\f0\b0 \
5:48\
Press will also get the long head very\
5:50\
stretched and can be a bit faster to set\
5:52\
up than cables I like to do these seated\
5:54\
because you'll be more stable meaning\
5:55\
you'll be able to direct more of that\
5:56\
tension coming from the dumbbell\
5:58\
directly to the triceps one slight\
6:00\
downside compared to the cables though\
6:01\
is that the dumbbell will provide a\
6:03\
circular resistance path meaning you get\
6:05\
a lot of tension on the triceps at the\
6:06\
bottom and less tension at the top it's\
6:08\
not such a bad thing though because the\
6:10\
stretched aspect does seem to be more\
6:11\
important anyway but I still prefer the\
6:13\
more uniform feel of the cables my main\
6:15\
issue with these is that as your triceps\
6:17\
get really strong the dumbbells may get\
6:19\
so big and bulky that they're kind of\
6:20\
awkward to handle and it can put some\
6:22\
unwanted strain on the wrists I still\
6:24\
like the French press and I still\
6:25\
include these periodically but I do\
6:27\
prefer the cables and I'm going to put\
6:28\
these in B tier doing these one arm at a\

\f1\b 1 Arm Dumbbell Overhead Extension
\f0\b0 \
6:31\
time actually solves a few of those\
6:32\
issues this way you can find a good\
6:33\
angle to point your elbows in that feels\
6:35\
a little more comfortable on your\
6:36\
shoulders and because you're doing one\
6:38\
arm at a time the dumbbell will be less\
6:39\
bulky and awkward they still don't offer\
6:41\
the same smooth tension as cables do but\
6:43\
they're a really good option especially\
6:45\
if you only have access to dumbbells one\
6:47\
arm dumbbell tricep extensions are going\
6:49\
in a tier all right so what about Skull\

\f1\b Skullcrusher
\f0\b0 \
6:51\
Crushers well let's see they offer super\
6:53\
high tension while the triceps are most\
6:55\
stretched especially if you Arc the bar\
6:57\
back behind your head instead of\
6:59\
literally stopping at your skull they\
7:00\
should feel good especially if you use\
7:02\
an easy bar which can ease up some\
7:03\
unwanted strain on the wrists and\
7:05\
they're a great movement for overloading\
7:07\
the triceps as you can always add a\
7:08\
little weight or a rep from week to week\
7:10\
and even though you don't get uniform\
7:12\
tension on the triceps you can fix that\
7:14\
by starting the range of motion with\
7:15\
your elbows slightly back rather than\
7:17\
straight up this will immediately pull\
7:19\
some tension into the fibers and from\
7:21\
there you can Arc the weight back I\
7:22\
think this is my favorite free weight\
7:24\
triceps exercise and even though some\
7:26\
people find them a little less smooth\
7:27\
than cables I think they're great I do\
7:29\
them a lot and yeah I think Skull\
7:31\
Crushers belong in s tier dumbbell Skull\

\f1\b Dumbbell Skullcrusher
\f0\b0 \
7:33\
Crushers are the exact same movement\
7:35\
except you get to train each arm\
7:37\
individually which is nice I'm not\
7:39\
exactly sure why but the dumbbell skull\
7:40\
crusher always feels a little more\
7:42\
Awkward to me than an easy bar or\
7:43\
straight bar skull crusher maybe it's\
7:45\
because the dumbbells are free moving\
7:46\
and in that lying overhead position I\
7:48\
just find them harder to control so\
7:50\
while on paper they should also be an S\
7:52\
tier in practice I find them a little\
7:54\
more awkward and for that reason I'm\
7:56\
knocking them back to a tier now the JM\

\f1\b JM Press
\f0\b0 \
7:58\
press is an interesting one people who\
8:00\
like this exercise really like this\
8:02\
exercise I think it's a bit overrated in\
8:04\
the strength and powerlifting space it's\
8:05\
really just a hybrid between a close\
8:06\
grip bench press and a skull crusher\
8:08\
instead of lowering the bar back behind\
8:10\
your head like in a skull crusher or\
8:11\
lowering the bar down to your chest like\
8:13\
in a close grip bench you meet in the\
8:14\
middle and lower the bar down to your\
8:15\
chin area I don't know I've been trying\
8:17\
these for years and I always feel a\
8:19\
little elbow pain or at least a little\
8:20\
elbow discomfort whenever I do them so\
8:22\
they're losing a point in the feels good\
8:23\
department for me because your arms\
8:25\
won't be as far back behind your head\
8:27\
the JM press also won't get the long\
8:28\
head quite as St eted as a skull crusher\
8:30\
will and I think if you're already doing\
8:31\
some bench press and you're already\
8:33\
doing some kind of overhead extension\
8:34\
I'm not sure that you really need a JM\
8:36\
press that said I am a fan of hitting\
8:38\
the triceps from a variety of different\
8:39\
shoulder angles and I do think that it's\
8:41\
a solid lift that should have some\
8:42\
strength carry over to your bench press\
8:44\
all things considered I'm going to put\
8:45\
the JM press in B tier as a muscle\
8:48\
builder the Smith machine JM press fixes\

\f1\b Smith Machine JM Press
\f0\b0 \
8:50\
a few of those issues for me where\
8:52\
you're locked into a fixed movement path\
8:54\
I do find it easier to really focus on\
8:55\
using my triceps to move the weight\
8:57\
whereas with the barbell my PC and delts\
8:59\
can can sometimes take over more I like\
9:00\
JM presses on the Smith machine a bit\
9:02\
better personally and so I'm putting\
9:04\
them in a tier triceps Kickbacks are one\

\f1\b Cable Triceps Kickback
\f0\b0 \
9:06\
of the very few exercises where you get\
9:08\
to smash the triceps with the arm held\
9:10\
back behind the Torso this is important\
9:12\
because remember that the long head of\
9:14\
the triceps will reach Peak stretch when\
9:16\
the arms are up overhead but reach Peak\
9:18\
contraction when the arms are held back\
9:20\
behind the Torso so this far this is the\
9:22\
first exercise we've covered that'll get\
9:24\
the long head into a full squeeze a lot\
9:27\
of people do Kickbacks bent forward but\
9:29\
if you think about it biomechanically\
9:30\
it's really the exact same thing as\
9:32\
doing them more upright with the arm\
9:33\
kick back and even though there is\
9:35\
research suggesting that the triceps\
9:36\
respond better to Long muscle lengths it\
9:38\
just isn't quite strong enough or robust\
9:40\
enough for me to throw out every short\
9:42\
and biased exercise plus you can still\
9:44\
get the lateral and medial heads\
9:45\
decently stretched here and the cable\
9:47\
provides nice even tension throughout\
9:48\
the range of motion they feel good to me\
9:50\
and I prefer to do these with slightly\
9:52\
higher reps and really focus on getting\
9:54\
a big strong contraction in my triceps\
9:56\
cable triceps Kickbacks are going in a\
9:59\
here now if you switch to a dumbbell you\

\f1\b Dumbbell Triceps Kickback
\f0\b0 \
10:01\
do make the exercise less effective\
10:03\
that's because the dumbbell offers zero\
10:05\
tension while the tricep is stretched\
10:07\
and then tension increases as the muscle\
10:09\
contracts this isn't great because we'd\
10:11\
want to bias tension toward the\
10:12\
stretched aspect as much as we can and\
10:14\
the dumbbell kickback does the exact\
10:16\
opposite that said I don't think this is\
10:18\
quite as big of a deal as people make it\
10:20\
seem the kickback is already better at\
10:21\
overloading the shorten position so the\
10:23\
fact that the dumbbells resistance curve\
10:24\
leans into that isn't an automatic deal\
10:26\
breaker that said if you do have access\
10:28\
to cables I I definitely think you\
10:29\
should do cable Kickbacks instead if you\
10:31\
only have access to dumbbells I think\
10:33\
putting the dumbbell up overhead and\
10:34\
doing overhead extensions will give you\
10:36\
more bang for your buck dumbbell\
10:37\
Kickbacks are a little overhated online\
10:40\
in my opinion but they're still not one\
10:41\
of my go-tos and I'm going to put them\
10:43\
in C tier post grip dips are another\

\f1\b Close Grip Dips
\f0\b0 \
10:45\
exercise that'll work the triceps with\
10:47\
the arms back behind the Torso so they\
10:49\
offer a really strong contraction of the\
10:51\
long head but because the arms aren't up\
10:53\
overhead the long head never really gets\
10:55\
a deep stretch dips also don't feel the\
10:57\
best to me I find my shoulders get a bit\
10:58\
cranky if I do them too much or too\
11:00\
heavy but I know tons of people who can\
11:02\
do them with no problem the Dip's\
11:03\
biggest upside is that as a compound\
11:05\
exercise it's great for Progressive\
11:07\
overload you can always add a rep or two\
11:08\
from week to week and use a weight belt\
11:10\
to add weight as you get stronger so the\
11:12\
close grip dip probably should be an A\
11:14\
or S tier on paper but because it\
11:16\
doesn't feel the best to me and I find\
11:17\
my PEC and delts can easily take over\
11:19\
I'm dropping it back to B tier bench\

\f1\b Bench Dips
\f0\b0 \
11:21\
dips work the triceps in a similar\
11:22\
shoulder position and I do find these\
11:24\
take my pecs and delts out of the\
11:25\
movement much better so I can connect\
11:27\
with my triceps a little more that said\
11:29\
their fatal flaw is in the Progressive\
11:31\
overload Department as you gain tricep\
11:33\
strength the exercise simply isn't going\
11:34\
to be challenging enough in a normal rep\
11:36\
range and then you'll need to add weight\
11:38\
you can have a partner load some weight\
11:39\
in your lap but I always find this a bit\
11:41\
awkward to balance All Things Considered\
11:43\
I'm putting the bench dip in C tier\

\f1\b Machine Dips
\f0\b0 \
11:45\
machine dips are actually pretty solid I\
11:47\
don't do them a whole lot in my own\
11:48\
training just because I like cable\
11:50\
Kickbacks better but I might add these\
11:51\
back in for my next training phase\
11:53\
they're really just a more locked in\
11:54\
version of a freee dip except if you can\
11:56\
find a good machine you'll have a little\
11:58\
more stability which which might help\
11:59\
you connect with your triceps better\
12:01\
that said I still find my PEC and delts\
12:03\
can take over on some of these machines\
12:05\
so I'm going to leave the machine dip in\
12:06\
be here as well okay the close grip\

\f1\b Close-Grip Bench Press
\f0\b0 \
12:08\
bench press similar to the dip its main\
12:11\
selling feature is its incredible\
12:12\
capacity for Progressive overload as\
12:14\
your triceps get stronger you'll be able\
12:16\
to gradually add a little weight each\
12:17\
week and keep your triceps growing for\
12:19\
years to come the bar will provide\
12:21\
consistent tension throughout the range\
12:22\
of motion and to me a close grip bench\
12:24\
press feels great I actually find I can\
12:26\
engage my triceps a lot better here than\
12:28\
on dip that said there's a slight\
12:30\
problem with the long head while presses\
12:32\
will smash the medial and lateral heads\
12:34\
extremely well the long head actually\
12:36\
doesn't get hit all that hard that's\
12:37\
because it's lengthening at the shoulder\
12:39\
joint while simultaneously shortening at\
12:42\
the elbow joint so while I really want\
12:43\
to put the close grip bench press in s\
12:45\
tier because it is such a great\
12:46\
overloading movement I have to drop it\
12:48\
back to a tier just because I don't\
12:50\
think that the long head will grow as\
12:52\
well from these as they will from an\
12:54\
overhead extension but I definitely\
12:55\
think it's an exercise that's worth\
12:57\
doing if you're trying to grow your\
12:58\
triceps the close grip push-up has very\

\f1\b Close-Grip Pushup
\f0\b0 \
13:00\
similar biomechanics so it'll also hit\
13:02\
the lateral and medial heads harder than\
13:04\
the long head but the main issue with\
13:05\
the push-up is that beyond the beginner\
13:07\
stage it's just really hard to overload\
13:09\
them without doing a ton of reps or\
13:11\
having a partner load weight on your\
13:12\
back which can be a pain I'm putting\
13:14\
these in C tier diamond push-ups make\

\f1\b Diamond Pushup
\f0\b0 \
13:16\
the movement considerably Harder by\
13:18\
narrowing the base of support and most\
13:20\
people can feel their triceps working\
13:21\
harder with the more flared elbow\
13:23\
position that it puts you in I actually\
13:24\
really like diamond push-ups as a\
13:26\
finisher exercise at the end of a\
13:27\
workout where you can just go for as\
13:29\
many reps as you can get they're\
13:30\
actually a lot harder than they look and\
13:32\
even though they're still not as good as\
13:33\
a close grip bench press for Progressive\
13:35\
overload I think they're just good\
13:36\
enough to get into B tier so here's what\

\f1\b Tricep training keys
\f0\b0 \
13:38\
you need to know first pressing\
13:40\
exercises will grow your triceps but\
13:43\
probably won't be enough on their own to\
13:44\
maximize triceps development especially\
13:46\
not the long head second you should\
13:48\
definitely do some triceps isolation\
13:50\
work for maximum growth third the most\
13:52\
effective isolation exercise is one that\
13:54\
trains the triceps with the arms\
13:56\
overhead this is so the long head can\
13:58\
experience High tension in a deep\
14:00\
stretch fourth for proportional triceps\
14:02\
development you should hit them from a\
14:04\
variety of different shoulder angles\
14:06\
including at least one mement with the\
14:07\
arms up overhead and one with the arms\
14:09\
either down at the sides like in a push\
14:11\
down and or One movement with the arm\
14:13\
held back behind the Torso like a cable\
14:15\
Kickback now if I had to Crown just one\
14:17\
exercise as the best of the best it'd\
14:18\
have to be the overhead cable tricep\
14:21\
extension this exercise will grow all\
14:22\
three heads very effectively and it's\
14:24\
actually been validated as a superior\
14:26\
exercise in long-term hypertrophy\
14:28\
studies and if I had to one is the worst\
14:29\
of the worst I guess itd have to be the\
14:31\
dumbbell kickback it's not that it never\
14:33\
has its place but I do think there are\
14:34\
better options and you may have noticed\
14:36\
that there were no F tier exercises in\
14:38\
this video but there definitely were in\
14:40\
my back tier list video so to make sure\
14:41\
that you don't put them in your program\

\f1\b \cf0 What makes a Chest exercise S tier?
\f0\b0 \
0:00\
what are the best and worst chest\
0:01\
exercises for muscle growth well for a\
0:03\
chest movement to rank highly it needs\
0:05\
to tick three boxes one a big stretch\
0:08\
with high tension if it doesn't offer\
0:10\
high tension in a deep stretch I'm\
0:12\
putting in an F tier no exceptions two\
0:15\
it needs to feel good it shouldn't cause\
0:17\
pain and it should have a smooth\
0:19\
resistance profile giving a good pump\
0:21\
and a nice mind muscle connection would\
0:22\
be nice too three it needs to have a\
0:25\
simple progression if you can't\
0:26\
progressively overload by adding weight\
0:28\
or reps that's not good and after\
0:30\
ranking 20 of the most popular movements\
0:32\
from s for super to F for fail at the\
0:35\
end I'll Crown one exercise as the best\
0:38\
of the chest raising it to S tier plus\
0:40\
and one as the most inept for the pecs\
0:42\
sending it to F tier hell all right\
0:44\
let's get the worst out of the way the\

\f1\b Hex Press
\f0\b0 \
0:46\
hex press I'm not a big fan of these\
0:48\
first you never get a big stretch in\
0:50\
your pecs because your arms never\
0:51\
stretch out they stay tucked in the\
0:54\
whole time and they don't offer maximum\
0:55\
tension because your triceps will take\
0:57\
over there's no evidence that these\
0:59\
Target the in incs in fact I think\
1:01\
they'd probably be worse for the incs\
1:03\
than a standard dumbbell press since the\
1:04\
in PEC fibers aren't getting as\
1:06\
stretched here the hex press is going in\
1:08\
F tier the plate press is basically a\

\f1\b Plate Press
\f0\b0 \
1:10\
hex press that feels even more Awkward\
1:12\
with even less overload potential so\
1:15\
it's also going in F tier the dumbbell\

\f1\b Dumbbell Pullover
\f0\b0 \
1:17\
pullover is a tricky one biomechanics\
1:19\
tells us that the pecs do help perform\
1:21\
this movement alongside the lats and\
1:23\
triceps and when you look at the\
1:24\
activation data the pecs do activate on\
1:26\
pullovers the problem is I simply don't\
1:28\
feel my pecs when I do this movement\
1:30\
whatsoever and more or less every client\
1:32\
I've ever worked with says the same and\
1:34\
I don't see many top bodybuilders\
1:35\
putting these on their chest day so\
1:36\
despite some theoretical Merit I think\
1:38\
pullovers are a much better lat exercise\
1:40\
than a PE exercise and for that reason\
1:43\
I'm going to put them in D tier all\
1:45\
right let's look at some better\
1:46\
exercises the bench press my ranking\

\f1\b Bench Press
\f0\b0 \
1:48\
might surprise you here it offers high\
1:50\
tension on the pecs as long as you bring\
1:52\
the bar all the way down to your chest\
1:54\
it's very easy to overload and you can\
1:55\
always add some weight over time as you\
1:57\
get stronger it feels good to me\
1:59\
although many people do complain that\
2:01\
the bench press makes their shoulders\
2:02\
feel a little cranky I suspect that's\
2:04\
because they're trying to lift more\
2:05\
weight than they should be lifting but I\
2:07\
still hear the issue commonly enough\
2:08\
that I do count it as a slight negative\
2:10\
so if it were just me I think I'd\
2:12\
probably put the bench press in s tier I\
2:14\
credit most of my own PEC development to\
2:16\
this exercise however it is true that\
2:17\
the barbell won't allow the PEC to get\
2:19\
in quite as deep of a stretch as\
2:21\
dumbbells do since it'll come up solid\
2:23\
against your rib cage and based on my\
2:24\
coaching experience not everyone gets as\
2:26\
much pack activation out of the bench\
2:28\
press as I do so for thaton reason I'm\
2:30\
going to hesitantly drop it back to a\
2:32\
tier the incline bench press has all the\

\f1\b Incline Bench Press
\f0\b0 \
2:34\
same upsides as the flat bench press\
2:36\
except it slightly emphasizes the upper\
2:38\
pecs now a lot of people think this\
2:39\
means it isn't as good for the mid and\
2:41\
lower pecs as the flat bench however a\
2:44\
recent study found that the incline\
2:45\
bench press caused the same lower and\
2:48\
mid pek growth as the flat bench did\
2:50\
plus better upper PEC growth so it's\
2:52\
very close to S tier but I think I'm\
2:54\
going to leave it in a tier as well the\

\f1\b Decline Bench Press
\f0\b0 \
2:56\
decline bench press doesn't have any\
2:57\
long-term research comparing pet growth\
2:59\
like the incline and flat bench however\
3:01\
biomechanics tells us that a decline\
3:03\
angle should Target the mid and lower\
3:05\
pecs a bit more however it has two minor\
3:08\
downsides for one in my experience more\
3:11\
people struggle with getting their upper\
3:12\
pecs to grow than their mid to lower\
3:14\
pecs so if you're trying to shift the\
3:15\
bias I would shift it toward the upper\
3:17\
pecs for most people second the decline\
3:19\
bench does have slightly less range of\
3:21\
motion than both the flat and the\
3:23\
incline press so out of the three angle\
3:25\
options I would say it's my least\
3:26\
favorite I know some people swear by it\
3:28\
and it clearly isn't effective chest\
3:30\
Builder it's very close to being in a\
3:32\
tier but I'm going to put it in B tier\
3:34\
all right the flat dumbbell press this\

\f1\b Flat Dumbbell Press
\f0\b0 \
3:36\
offers a deeper stretch on the pecs than\
3:38\
the barbell because the dumbbells can\
3:39\
move freely past the rib cage they feel\
3:41\
great you should get a great chest pump\
3:43\
on these and because people are less\
3:45\
likely to let their ego takeover on this\
3:47\
exercise is less common for people to\
3:48\
have shoulder issues as a beginner and\
3:50\
intermediate level lifter you should be\
3:52\
able to progressively overload this\
3:53\
movement just fine by either adding reps\
3:55\
or increasing the weight of the\
3:56\
dumbbells however once you get decently\
3:59\
strong you may max out the dumbbell rack\
4:00\
at your gym which usually stops at 100\
4:02\
lb also once you get that strong the\
4:04\
dumbbells get so big and bulky that they\
4:06\
can be quite awkward to handle so while\
4:08\
the flat dumbbell press is just about an\
4:09\
S tier it's getting knocked down to a\
4:11\
tier for those potential overloading\
4:13\
issues in more advanced lifters the\
4:15\
incline dumbbell press is also going in\

\f1\b Incline Dumbbell Press
\f0\b0 \
4:17\
a tier since the same basic movement\
4:20\
with the same upsides and downside\
4:22\
except again it has slightly more\
4:23\
emphasis on the upper pecs and I'm\

\f1\b Decline Dumbbell Press
\f0\b0 \
4:25\
putting the decline dumbbell press in B\
4:27\
tier since I do find it awkward to set\
4:28\
up you'll probably need someone to hand\
4:30\
you the dumbbells and again lower pecs\
4:32\
rarely need any extra emphasis okay the\
4:34\
machine chest press a good chest press\

\f1\b Machine Chest Press
\f0\b0 \
4:37\
machine will give a nice deep stretch on\
4:39\
the pecs and provide high tension\
4:41\
throughout the range of motion unlike\
4:42\
barbells and dumbbells you're more\
4:44\
locked in which should help increase the\
4:46\
Mind muscle connection with your pecs\
4:47\
and give them massive pump machines are\
4:49\
very easy to overload you can always add\
4:51\
some weight or a rep from week to week\
4:52\
and they have the advantage of being a\
4:54\
little safer to push to failure than\
4:55\
free weights assuming you have a good\
4:57\
chest press machine that takes all those\
4:59\
boxes is I really can't think of a\
5:01\
downside from a muscle building\
5:02\
standpoint and so the machine chest\
5:04\
press is our first exercise getting\
5:06\
awarded to S tier all right dips let's\

\f1\b Dips
\f0\b0 \
5:09\
see massive stretch on the pecs possibly\
5:11\
the best compound exercise I'm aware of\
5:13\
for getting into a deep PEC stretch they\
5:15\
offer high tension and there's many ways\
5:17\
to apply Progressive overload you can do\
5:19\
assisted dips and reduce the assistance\
5:21\
weight over time or you can do body\
5:23\
weight dips and add reps or you can slow\
5:25\
down the negative a bit more from week\
5:26\
to week and then as you gain more\
5:28\
strength you can use a weight belt to\
5:29\
add external load the only downside of\
5:31\
dips is that some people find that their\
5:33\
shoulders get cranky if they do them too\
5:35\
much although I've never actually\
5:36\
experienced that personally but I will\
5:38\
say I don't think dips have the\
5:39\
smoothest feel so despite many upsides\
5:42\
they are taking a slight hit in the\
5:44\
feels good department for me and for\
5:46\
that reason I'm going to put them in a\
5:47\
tier instead of s tier they're\
5:49\
definitely an exercise worth including\
5:51\
though okay what about push-ups body\

\f1\b Push-Ups
\f0\b0 \
5:53\
weight push-ups are nice because you can\
5:55\
do them anywhere without any equipment\
5:57\
however assuming you do have gym access\
5:59\
I think there are far better options for\
6:01\
chest growth the problem is that once\
6:03\
you get decently strong you'll need to\
6:04\
do at least 30 plus reps to get close\
6:06\
enough to failure to maximize muscle\
6:08\
growth which isn't ideal I do think\
6:09\
that's fine if you're doing them as a\
6:11\
end of workout finisher but otherwise\
6:13\
doing all those reps can be exhausting\
6:15\
for no added benefit you also come up\
6:17\
solid against the floor before your pecs\
6:18\
are fully stretched and they're not that\
6:20\
easy to overload while you can have a\
6:21\
partner add some weight to your back the\
6:23\
weight always feels a bit unstable for\
6:25\
me they are a decent beginner exercise\
6:27\
but I'm still putting body weight\
6:28\
push-ups in tier banded push-ups do add\

\f1\b Banded Push-Ups
\f0\b0 \
6:31\
some extra tension to the movement\
6:33\
however almost all of that tension is\
6:35\
added to the top half rather than the\
6:36\
bottom half of the push-up so tension\
6:38\
still isn't being maximized while the\
6:40\
pecs are stretched I still think they're\
6:41\
a decent finisher though so I'll put\
6:43\
them in B tier deficit push-ups fix the\

\f1\b Deficit Push-Ups
\f0\b0 \
6:46\
problem of not getting a deep stretch on\
6:47\
the pecs and even though they're still a\
6:49\
bit tricky to overload you can make the\
6:51\
exercise more challenging by pausing for\
6:53\
2 to 3 seconds in the bottom I think\
6:55\
that if you're going to do push-ups this\
6:57\
is how you should do them deficit\
6:58\
push-ups are going in a tier I used to\
7:00\
do a lot of plyometric push-ups in my\

\f1\b Plyometric Push-Ups
\f0\b0 \
7:02\
early powerlifting days to build up\
7:04\
explosive chest power for the bench\
7:05\
press but I've fallen out of love with\
7:07\
them s they're just not great for\
7:09\
maximizing tension on the negative or in\
7:11\
the stretch and even though there is\
7:13\
some research supporting more explosive\
7:14\
training I'd rather use an explosive\
7:16\
Tempo on a weight loaded exercise like\
7:18\
the bench press if bodybuilding is the\
7:20\
goal I'm going to put these in D tier as\
7:22\
a chest Builder speaking of less\
7:24\
conventional exercises the guillotine\
7:26\
press is basically a normal flat bench\

\f1\b Guillotine Press
\f0\b0 \
7:28\
press except you shrug your shoulders up\
7:31\
flare your elbows out and lower the\
7:32\
barbell down to your neck a lot of\
7:34\
people kick up a big fuss about this\
7:36\
exercise causing shoulder issues but\
7:38\
there's no direct evidence or even\
7:39\
strong rationale to support that you can\
7:41\
listen to Dr Mike if you don't believe\
7:43\
me some people will bench press\
7:44\
Guillotine style where they take a\
7:46\
higher position on the chest and they\
7:48\
let their elbows come up they feel a\
7:49\
huge stretch in the pecs their shoulders\
7:51\
feel amazing no problem correct answer\
7:54\
other folks will touch a little bit\
7:55\
below the nipple line actually on their\
7:57\
abdomen and they will tuck their elbows\
7:59\
on the way down if that is what hits\
8:01\
your peex the most and it makes your\
8:03\
elbows and shoulders feel nice and comfy\
8:04\
and\
8:05\
safe beautiful right answer what I don't\
8:08\
want you guys to get caught up in is\
8:10\
people on the internet who say this is\
8:12\
bad because biomechanics I don't know\
8:14\
where the they say that because if\
8:16\
you go out here notice my pecs are\
8:18\
getting more stretched as I pull out\
8:20\
that said I do believe that for some\
8:21\
people especially those with\
8:23\
pre-existing shoulder issues flaring the\
8:25\
elbows might hurt so in that case I just\
8:27\
wouldn't bother with these however Gill\
8:29\
presses will stretch the pecs better\
8:31\
than any of the other barbell presses\
8:32\
we've discussed and it also has a cool\
8:34\
history in lifting culture I am a fan\
8:36\
and I would put it in a tier however\
8:38\
because it's potentially very dangerous\
8:40\
dropping the bar on your neck would be\
8:41\
lights out I'm going to go ahead and put\
8:43\
it in F tier I just don't think the\
8:45\
potential Hazard risk is worth any\
8:47\
potential marginal gains you'll get from\
8:48\
it that said if you modify the exercise\

\f1\b Dumbbell Guillotine Press
\f0\b0 \
8:50\
to do the same basic movement with\
8:52\
dumbbells it suddenly becomes much safer\
8:55\
and in that case I am going to put these\
8:57\
in a tier again these may fall in D tier\
8:59\
or F tier for those of you who get\
9:00\
shoulder pain from it but in my\
9:02\
experience the majority of lifters can\
9:04\
flare their elbows without issue just\
9:05\
start light and build up your tolerance\
9:07\
to round out the dumbbell press\

\f1\b 1-Arm Dumbbell Press
\f0\b0 \
9:09\
variations I guess I'll cover the one\
9:10\
arm dumbbell press I still see this\
9:12\
quite a bit at the gym but doing one arm\
9:14\
at a time has no Advantage because each\
9:16\
PEC has to work individually in a\
9:18\
dumbbell press anyway so doing them one\
9:19\
arm at a time just makes it harder to\
9:21\
keep your balance which disperses\
9:23\
tension away from the PCS maybe a bit\
9:25\
harsh but I'm going to put these in F\
9:27\
tier the Smith machine gets a lot of\

\f1\b Smith Machine Flat Bench Press
\f0\b0 \
9:28\
hate for some reason but studies\
9:30\
consistently show that it is effective\
9:32\
at building muscle across a variety of\
9:34\
different exercises I think it's a great\
9:36\
alternative to the standard bench press\
9:37\
with all the same upsides plus I find\
9:39\
I'm more confident pushing the Smith\
9:41\
machine press closer to failure these\
9:43\
are going in a tier along with the other\
9:45\
barbell presses and the incline Smith\

\f1\b Incline Smith Machine Press
\f0\b0 \
9:47\
machine press is the same basic movement\
9:49\
except with a little more upper peack\
9:50\
emphasis so they're also going in a tier\
9:53\
okay so far we've been discussing only\
9:54\
compound chest exercises presses dips\
9:57\
and push-up variations that will smash\
9:59\
the pecs but also Target the front delts\
10:01\
and triceps sometimes you want to\
10:03\
isolate the pecs and for that we've got\
10:05\
a bunch of PEC fly variations there's\
10:08\
Cable Crossovers seated cable PEC flies\
10:10\
the pec deck machine and dumbbell flies\
10:13\
let's start with Cable Crossovers these\

\f1\b Cable Crossovers
\f0\b0 \
10:14\
do provide a big stretch on the pecs\
10:16\
with nice smooth and even tension\
10:18\
throughout the range of motion they feel\
10:20\
good to me and usually give me a solid\
10:22\
chest pump they're not quite as\
10:23\
conducive to Progressive overload as\
10:25\
pressing movements simply because you\
10:26\
can't go as heavy but you can still add\
10:28\
a rep here and there and focus on\
10:30\
technique so that's not a deal breaker\
10:32\
the only downside to these is that by\
10:33\
doing them standing you may find that\
10:35\
the cable pulls your body back\
10:37\
especially as you get stronger which can\
10:38\
make it less stable you can correct for\
10:40\
this by bending forward and flying\
10:42\
downward so while it's close to being\
10:43\
perfect it's not the most stable fly\
10:46\
variation and for that reason I'm\
10:47\
putting it in a tier the seated PEC fly\

\f1\b Seated Cable Pec Flye
\f0\b0 \
10:50\
has all the same upsides as the cable\
10:52\
crossover but by sitting down you get\
10:54\
rid of the balancing component and\
10:56\
increase the stability of the exercise\
10:58\
which will make sure that all the\
10:59\
tension coming from the cables is being\
11:01\
applied directly to the pecs this is my\
11:03\
favorite chest isolation movement at the\
11:05\
moment and so I'm going to make it my\
11:06\
second addition to S tier the PC Tech\

\f1\b Pec Deck
\f0\b0 \
11:09\
Machine shares many of the same benefits\
11:10\
as you're also seated so it's nice and\
11:12\
stable and you'll be able to get a big\
11:14\
stretch on your pecs with high tension I\
11:16\
just don't find it feels quite as good\
11:17\
as the cables do the machine locks you\
11:19\
into a very specific movement path\
11:21\
whereas the cables allow your shoulder\
11:22\
to move a bit more freely this means you\
11:24\
may not be able to find that perfect\
11:26\
line of pull for your PC specifically\
11:28\
this is a pretty subjective one but I'm\
11:29\
going to put the pec deck machine in a\
11:31\
tier all right the dumbbell fly now a\

\f1\b Dumbbell Flye
\f0\b0 \
11:34\
couple years ago I probably would have\
11:35\
put this one in c-tier because you get\
11:37\
literally zero tension at the top of the\
11:39\
range of motion when the pecs are most\
11:41\
contracted however recent evidence has\
11:43\
shown that the contraction is most\
11:45\
likely not as important as the stretch\
11:47\
is for muscle growth and so I've opened\
11:49\
the dumbbell fly back up as a viable\
11:51\
option I like to do these all as length\
11:53\
into partials so I just cut out the top\
11:54\
half of the movement alt together where\
11:56\
there's no tension anyway but I still\
11:58\
don't think they're quite as smooth as\
11:59\
cable flies and so they're losing one\
12:01\
point in the feelsgood department I'm\
12:03\
putting dumbbell flies in a tier okay\
12:06\
let's finish off with three less common\
12:08\
exercises one that I hate one that I\
12:10\
love and one that's just okay the cable\

\f1\b Cable Press-Around
\f0\b0 \
12:13\
press around is probably the only\
12:14\
exercise we've covered so far that gets\
12:16\
the PEC fully contracted that's because\
12:18\
the Press around is a rare exercise\
12:20\
where you press the cable across your\
12:22\
midline so I do like to include it\
12:24\
periodically for this reason because\
12:27\
even though the stretch literature is\
12:28\
convincing to me I still think including\
12:30\
some short length biased work isn't a\
12:32\
bad idea until we get more evidence some\
12:35\
people do find the movement to be a bit\
12:36\
awkward at first but once you get the\
12:37\
hang of it it really is a great option I\
12:40\
love the Press around and it's going in\
12:42\
a tier the crossbody standing dumbbell\

\f1\b Cross-Body Standing Dumbbell Flye
\f0\b0 \
12:44\
fly is another exercise where you extend\
12:47\
your arm across your body to get the\
12:48\
upper pecs fully contracted but unlike\
12:51\
the cable press around the dumbbell\
12:53\
offers literally zero tension when the\
12:55\
PEC is stretched this is also basically\
12:57\
a front raise meaning the front delts\
12:58\
will steal a lot of the tension from the\
13:00\
pecs even if you squeeze them at the top\
13:02\
doing dumbbell flies lying down makes a\
13:04\
lot more sense biomechanically and so\
13:06\
these are going in F tier the floor\
13:08\
press is mainly used for developing\

\f1\b Floor Press
\f0\b0 \
13:10\
maximum bench press strength and it's an\
13:12\
exercise that I include in a lot of my\
13:13\
strength and power building programs as\
13:15\
I think it's great for smashing the\
13:17\
triceps and improving lockout strength\
13:19\
that said The Limited range of motion\
13:21\
makes it a less than ideal candid it for\
13:23\
chest hypertrophy as you never get the\
13:25\
pecs fully stretched so even though I do\
13:27\
love it for strength it's just okay for\
13:29\
pet growth and I'm going to leave it in\
13:31\
C tier now if I had to Crown just one\
13:34\
exercise as the best of the best I'd\
13:36\
probably go with a machine chess press\
13:38\
this is a broad category and some\
13:39\
machines are certainly better than\
13:41\
others but if you can find one that\
13:43\
feels good at your gym I definitely\
13:45\
think it's worth including it takes all\
13:46\
the regular boxes and you can safely\
13:48\
push it to failure and if I had to pick\
13:50\
one exercise as the worst of the worst\
13:52\
it probably be the plate press this is\
13:54\
just one of those exercises that\
13:55\
influencers do to be different but\
13:57\
unfortunately it comes with a ton of\
13:59\
downsides and no real upside also I just\
14:01\
launched phase two of my pure\
14:03\
bodybuilding program over on Jeff\
14:04\
napper.com so that's available for\
14:06\
pre-order right now phase one of the\
14:08\
program got the highest praise I've ever\
14:10\
received from a whole bunch of experts\
14:12\
in the field and I've got a long list of\
14:13\
amazing testimonials from people who ran\
14:15\
the programs Phase 2 builds on that by\
14:17\
introducing more than 90 new exercises\
14:20\
and plenty new intensity techniques many\
14:22\
of which I've never shown here on the\
14:23\
channel before if you pre-order you'll\
14:25\
get all three versions of the program\
14:27\
for the price of one so you'll get the\
14:28\
Push Pull legs upper lower and full body\
14:31\
versions of the program which is more\
14:32\
than 6 months of training in total and\
14:34\
the pre-order lasts for 1 week if you\
14:36\
didn't run Phase 1 yet I would recommend\
14:38\
starting with that one first and just\
14:40\
for this week only I'm also going to\
14:42\
knock phase one off by 30% so now might\
14:44\
be a good time to pick up both as this\
14:46\
is the most discounted they'll ever be\
14:48\
so I'll put a link to the new program\
14:49\
over here next to my head if you want to\
14:51\
check it out and there'll also be links\
14:52\
to both phases in the description box\
14:54\
down below as well as always thank you\
14:56\
guys so much for watching don't forget\
14:57\
to leave me a thumbs up if you enjoyed\

\f1\b \cf0 What makes an Back exercise S tier?
\f0\b0 \
0:00\
what are the best and worst back\
0:01\
exercises for muscle growth well in this\
0:04\
video I'll be ranking 20 of the most\
0:06\
popular movements on a tier list from s\
0:08\
for super to F for fail and at the end\
0:11\
I'll Crown one exercise as the best of\
0:13\
the best raising it to S tier plus and\
0:15\
one as the worst of the worst demoting\
0:17\
it to F tier hell and to make sure your\
0:19\
favorite back exercise doesn't end up in\
0:21\
F tier it'll need to take three boxes\
0:23\
one it needs to give a big stretch with\
0:26\
high tension if it doesn't give me a\
0:27\
good stretch or provide high tension\
0:29\
it's going an F tier no exceptions two\
0:32\
it needs to feel good this means it\
0:34\
doesn't cause pain and it has a smooth\
0:36\
resistance profile giving a good pump\
0:38\
and a nice mind muscle connection\
0:39\
wouldn't hurt either three it must have\
0:42\
a simple progression if you can't easily\
0:44\
add weight or reps over time it's\
0:46\
getting knocked down all right let's get\
0:47\
the worst out of the way Renegade rows\

\f1\b Renegade Rows
\f0\b0 \
0:50\
these are not good for building muscle\
0:52\
first they don't provide a good stretch\
0:53\
because you'll come up solid against the\
0:55\
floor they don't offer maximum tension\
0:56\
to your back because other muscles have\
0:58\
to work so hard just to keep your\
1:00\
balance which makes it hard to get a\
1:01\
good back pump sorry Renegade rows are\
1:03\
going in F tier this is because the\
1:05\
Renegade row is trying to combine two\
1:07\
exercises into one a plank and a\
1:09\
dumbbell row planks are good for your\
1:10\
core and rows are great for your back\
1:12\
when you put them together you end up\
1:14\
watering down the amount of tension that\
1:16\
your back receives and the same goes for\
1:18\
other twoin one combination exercises\
1:20\
like the dumbbell row plus curl or the\
1:21\
dumbbell row plus press or the dumbbell\
1:23\
row plus Kickback this is because the\
1:25\
smaller muscle in the pair will always\
1:27\
be so much weaker than your back so\
1:30\
it'll always give out first this leaves\
1:31\
your back totally UND stimulated these\
1:33\
exercises will burn some calories and\
1:35\
they will grow the weaker muscle in the\
1:37\
pair but they aren't good back Builders\
1:39\
they're all going in F tier okay what\

\f1\b Deadlift
\f0\b0 \
1:40\
about the deadlift well I am a big fan\
1:42\
of the deadlift I think it's one of the\
1:44\
best exercises for building total body\
1:46\
strength however when we look at the\
1:48\
criteria for S tier back Builder it\
1:50\
doesn't score too well it doesn't\
1:52\
stretch your lats or midback much at all\
1:54\
it also doesn't take your lats or traps\
1:56\
through an active range of motion so any\
1:58\
tension they do receive is isometric and\
2:01\
I don't know about you but deadlifts\
2:02\
don't give me a great back pump and\
2:04\
while they are easy to overload you can\
2:05\
always add some weight or some reps\
2:07\
that's usually because your hamstrings\
2:09\
and glutes are getting stronger not\
2:10\
necessarily your back as a back Builder\
2:12\
the deadlift is going in C tier I'm not\
2:15\
putting it in D or F tier just because\
2:17\
it will beef up your spinal Erectors and\
2:20\
thicken up that lower part of your back\
2:22\
but as a pure back hypertrophy exercise\
2:24\
I do think there are far better options\
2:26\
now if this were a lower body day I'd\
2:27\
probably put the deadlift in A or B tier\
2:29\
especially if it's done with a\
2:30\
well-controlled negative and since the\

\f1\b Above-The-Knee Rack Pull
\f0\b0 \
2:32\
above theee rack pull is basically just\
2:33\
a deadlift with less range of motion\
2:35\
it's going in D tier except since it\
2:38\
often damages gym equipment Hogs plates\
2:40\
and unless your name is bro feels pretty\
2:42\
terrible I'm going to go ahead and move\
2:44\
it to F tier okay you're probably ready\

\f1\b Wide-Grip Pull-Up
\f0\b0 \
2:46\
for some better exercises so let's start\
2:48\
with the wide grip pull-up it offers\
2:50\
high tension throughout the range of\
2:51\
motion and a deep stretch at the bottom\
2:53\
it feels good and you should get a nice\
2:55\
back pump however pull-ups do have a\
2:57\
tricky resistance profile they feel very\
2:59\
easy at the bottom and very hard at the\
3:02\
top this makes for not the smoothest\
3:04\
feel that said they are very good for\
3:06\
progression as you can easily add one\
3:08\
rep each workout or add some load with a\
3:10\
weight belt they also look cool and I\
3:12\
really respect pull-up strength wide\
3:14\
grip pull-ups are going in a tier\

\f1\b Neutral-Grip Pull-Up
\f0\b0 \
3:16\
neutral grip pull-ups have all the\
3:17\
upsides of wide grip pull-ups with\
3:19\
slightly more lat emphasis they're also\
3:21\
going in a tier chinups with a Palms up\

\f1\b Chin-Up
\f0\b0 \
3:23\
grip shift some back tension to your\
3:25\
biceps so while they are still a great\
3:27\
upper body exercise I'm putting them in\
3:29\
B tier for the back specifically next\
3:31\
pull Downs we've got wide grip laat pull\
3:33\
Downs neutral grip laap pull downs and\
3:35\
half kneeling one arm lap pull Downs\
3:37\
wide grip lat pull Downs offer a big\

\f1\b Wide-Grip Lat Pulldown
\f0\b0 \
3:39\
stretch on your lats they provide smooth\
3:41\
even tension throughout the range of\
3:43\
motion they feel great plus you get to\
3:45\
sit down which is nice and stable and\
3:47\
you get a fantastic combination of both\
3:49\
lat and mid trap activation and you can\
3:51\
easily overload them by increasing the\
3:53\
pin weight the wide grip pull down is\
3:55\
our first exercise being awarded to S\
3:58\
tier neutral grip pull Downs have all\

\f1\b Neutral-Grip Lat Pulldown
\f0\b0 \
3:59\
the same upsides of wide grip pull Downs\
4:01\
except they emphasize your lats over the\
4:03\
mid traps especially if you think about\
4:05\
driving your elbows down so they're also\
4:07\
going in s here half kneeling one arm\

\f1\b Half-Kneeling 1-Arm Lat Pulldown
\f0\b0 \
4:09\
lap pull Downs are heralded as being oh\
4:11\
so optimal online so let's see how they\
4:13\
do high stretch check high tension check\
4:17\
good feel at least for me check and\
4:19\
they're easy to overload you can easily\
4:20\
add a rep each week and then some weight\
4:22\
as you get stronger there is a little\
4:24\
less stability here than on a pull down\
4:25\
machine however you can overcome that by\
4:27\
bracing against your knee or against an\
4:29\
in bench plus being able to focus on one\
4:31\
lad at a time is great for preventing\
4:33\
asymmetries so while I'm tempted to put\
4:35\
them in a tier I'm going to be lenient\
4:36\
and put them in s tier as well now the\

\f1\b Cross-Body Lat Pull-Around
\f0\b0 \
4:38\
cross body lat pull around is a spin on\
4:40\
the same movement where you twist your\
4:42\
torso by 90\'b0 so that you're pulling the\
4:44\
cable across your body this will\
4:46\
increase the stretch on your lats even\
4:48\
further however I find that despite the\
4:50\
amazing Stretch A lot of people find the\
4:52\
movement a bit awkward especially at\
4:54\
first so I'm going to leave these in a\
4:56\
tier okay let's cover some of the most\
4:57\
popular row variations up first the\

\f1\b Barbell Row
\f0\b0 \
5:00\
barbell row it stretches your back quite\
5:02\
well and it offers high tension however\
5:04\
because it's not the most stable\
5:06\
exercise that tension will be dispersed\
5:09\
to other stabilizing muscles like your\
5:11\
calves glutes and low back just to keep\
5:13\
balance this isn't a huge deal your back\
5:15\
will still get hammered and you can\
5:16\
still overload this movement from week\
5:17\
to week but I don't think it's the best\
5:19\
row variation and I don't even think\
5:21\
it's the best barbell row variation so\
5:23\
the standard barbell row is going in B\
5:25\
tier the Yates row is basically just a\

\f1\b Yates Row
\f0\b0 \
5:28\
barbell row with a more upright posture\
5:30\
and with looser technique of course it's\
5:31\
named after bodybuilding Legend and\
5:33\
six-time Mr Olympia Dorian Yates while\
5:35\
the looser form will help you load more\
5:37\
weight it doesn't actually guarantee\
5:39\
more tension to your back muscles\
5:41\
because of momentum coming from your\
5:42\
hips and the more upright posture\
5:44\
actually reduces the stretch on your\
5:46\
lats and mid traps sorry Dorian the\
5:49\
eight row is going in C tier the penl\

\f1\b Pendlay Row
\f0\b0 \
5:51\
row is essentially the opposite of the\
5:53\
eight row instead of going more upright\
5:55\
you go more bent over this is good\
5:57\
because it places your lats under a\
5:58\
higher degree of stretch and tension it\
6:00\
also allows for more consistent\
6:02\
progression since your form is tighter\
6:04\
so assuming you do them with a\
6:05\
controlled negative I think they belong\
6:07\
in B tier although I could easily nudge\
6:09\
them into a tier if we factor in\
6:11\
strength development they're just not\
6:12\
quite stable enough as a pure\
6:14\
hypertrophy exercise for my taste so\
6:17\
they're going to stay in B tier the\

\f1\b Deficit Pendlay Row
\f0\b0 \
6:18\
deficit penl row is a penl row where you\
6:20\
stand on something like a bumper plate\
6:22\
this allows you to go deeper on the\
6:23\
negative meaning more stretch on your\
6:25\
lats I'm going to put these in a tier\

\f1\b Meadows Row
\f0\b0 \
6:28\
all right The Meadows row named after\
6:29\
the late great John Meadows who is\
6:31\
someone who taught me so much so let's\
6:34\
see it stretches your back a ton it\
6:36\
absolutely smashes your midback with\
6:38\
super high tension and as long as you\
6:39\
brace against your knee you'll be nice\
6:41\
and stable the midback pump you'll get\
6:43\
from these is unmatched and as a bonus\
6:45\
you get to work on each side\
6:47\
individually this is definitely a\
6:48\
personal favorite and easily belongs in\
6:51\
s tier for me the inverted row is\

\f1\b Inverted Row
\f0\b0 \
6:53\
basically an upside down row where you\
6:54\
pull your own body instead of pulling\
6:56\
some weight they offer a pretty amazing\
6:58\
stretch at the bottom and I can't lie\
7:00\
they feel pretty great too if you set it\
7:02\
up right you should feel nice and locked\
7:03\
in and you should be able to feel a\
7:05\
strong mind muscle connection with your\
7:06\
back however they're getting knocked\
7:08\
down for progression while you can have\
7:10\
a training partner load some weight in\
7:11\
your lap this also makes the movement\
7:12\
feel really awkward for me at least and\
7:14\
then without the weight you're stuck\
7:16\
with doing Super High Reps which is fine\
7:18\
but it is suboptimal once you go above\
7:20\
30 or 40 reps so despite some positive\
7:22\
aspects I'm going to put inverted rows\
7:24\
in C tier one arm dumbbell rows the\

\f1\b 1-Arm Dumbbell Row
\f0\b0 \
7:27\
zombie corpse of athleen x's X exercise\
7:29\
graveyard obviously this exercise gets a\
7:31\
bad rap online but other than athleen x\
7:33\
I've actually never heard another\
7:35\
physiotherapist or exercise scientist\
7:36\
Express concerns about it I've been\
7:38\
doing them myself and with clients for\
7:39\
more than a decade without a single\
7:41\
issue so let's see they offer a big\
7:43\
stretch on your lats at the bottom and\
7:44\
they feel nice smooth and stable the\
7:47\
main issue is once your back gets\
7:48\
decently strong you may max out the\
7:50\
dumbbell rack at your gym which usually\
7:52\
stops at 100 lb so they're getting\
7:53\
knocked down slightly for progression\
7:55\
but I'm still going to put them in a\

\f1\b Kroc Row
\f0\b0 \
7:57\
tier The Croc row is basically just a\
7:58\
dumbbell row with looser form so you use\
8:01\
some leg drive and some momentum on the\
8:02\
positive now I'm normally not a fan of\
8:04\
loose technique however where you're\
8:06\
braced against the bench the momentum\
8:08\
here is actually more controlled and\
8:09\
consistent than it normally is also the\
8:11\
momentum leans into the natural strength\
8:13\
curve of the back quite well it gives\
8:14\
you some assistance and getting through\
8:16\
the harder top half of the range while\
8:18\
still offering a nice stretch at the\
8:19\
bottom I may get some Flack for this\
8:21\
from the technique junkies but I'm\
8:22\
putting Croc rows in a tier okay\

\f1\b Free-Standing Row
\f0\b0 \
8:25\
freestanding tear rows probably the most\
8:28\
epic looking exercise especially if you\
8:30\
look like Ronnie Coleman but the problem\
8:31\
is I just don't love them they do give a\
8:33\
nice stretch on your lats and the\
8:34\
tension that your back gets will be high\
8:36\
I just find them to be annoying balance\
8:38\
can be an issue once you get decently\
8:40\
strong and the other end of the bar will\
8:41\
often pop up if you don't have a land\
8:43\
mine attachment you can progress on them\
8:44\
well by adding reps or load but they're\
8:46\
getting knocked down in the feels good\
8:48\
department for me I'm thinking C tier\
8:50\
but I'll go ahead and put them in B tier\
8:52\
for Ronnie now chess supported rows give\

\f1\b Chest-Supported Row
\f0\b0 \
8:54\
you all the positives of the\
8:55\
freestanding tar row but with a much\
8:57\
more stable and secure feel feel having\
8:59\
your chest supported allows you to focus\
9:01\
all the tension to your back these are\
9:03\
an absolute staple and should 100% be\
9:06\
included in your bodybuilding routine if\
9:08\
you don't have a chest supported machine\
9:09\
you can do dumbbell Helm's rows where\
9:11\
you brace your chest against the back of\
9:12\
an incline bench you can do these as\
9:14\
tear rows or whatever machine helps you\
9:16\
engage your back the best either way\
9:18\
chest supported rows are going in s tier\
9:21\
for sure cable rows are another personal\

\f1\b Cable Row
\f0\b0 \
9:23\
favorite they may actually be the single\
9:25\
best exercise that I know of for feeling\
9:27\
a deep stretch on my lats especially\
9:29\
when when I lean forward on the negative\
9:30\
they also give me a crazy laat pump and\
9:32\
you can always increase the Reps or\
9:33\
weight from week to week these are going\
9:35\
in s tier as well switching to a wide\

\f1\b Wide-Grip Cable Row
\f0\b0 \
9:37\
grip will shift some emphasis to the mid\
9:39\
traps especially if you squeeze your\
9:40\
shoulder blades together but that's not\
9:42\
a bad thing if that's what you're trying\
9:43\
to Target and wide grip cable rows have\
9:45\
all the same benefits of close grip\
9:46\
cable rows so they also belong in s tier\
9:49\
speaking of your midback the Rope face\

\f1\b Rope Face-Pull
\f0\b0 \
9:51\
pull is a very popular option it does\
9:53\
stretch your midback well as long as you\
9:55\
pull your shoulder blades apart on the\
9:56\
negative and you should be able to feel\
9:58\
a strong mind muscle connection\
9:59\
connection with your entire midback the\
10:01\
issue is they're a bit unstable when\
10:03\
done the conventional way because the\
10:04\
cable is always trying to pull your body\
10:06\
forward and so a lot of that tension is\
10:08\
simply lost trying to keep your balance\
10:10\
for this reason the standard rope face\
10:12\
pull is going in B tier however if you\
10:14\
modify the exercise to do it either\
10:16\
lying on the floor or by doing them\
10:17\
seated you eliminate that balancing\
10:19\
requirement and you'll be able to\
10:21\
overload them with much more tension\
10:22\
being applied directly to your back so\
10:24\
I'm going to go ahead and put both of\
10:26\
these variations in a tier they're close\
10:28\
to being an S tier\
10:29\
but just looking at the other exercises\
10:31\
in s tier so far I don't think face\
10:33\
pulls are quite as amazing definitely\
10:34\
still an exercise worth including though\
10:36\
for sure the cable lat pullover or the\

\f1\b Cable Lat Pull-Over
\f0\b0 \
10:39\
lat prayer offers a huge stretch on your\
10:41\
lats as long as you bend forward on the\
10:43\
negative and you should be able to feel\
10:44\
a strong mind muscle connection with\
10:45\
your lats these are better done for\
10:47\
higher reps so they aren't as easily\
10:49\
overloaded as some of the compound\
10:50\
exercises we've covered but you can\
10:52\
always add a rep here and there and the\
10:53\
incredible mind muscle connection and\
10:55\
the Deep stretch make up for it in my\
10:57\
opinion that said it's fairly common for\
10:58\
people people to feel their triceps\
11:00\
taking over on this exercise but once\
11:01\
you get the hang of the movement and\
11:03\
learn how to engage your lats by simply\
11:05\
driving your elbows down I do think\
11:06\
they're a great way to get some extra\
11:08\
lat isolation volume without causing any\
11:10\
total body fatigue and so I'm going to\
11:11\
put cable lat prayers in a tier now the\

\f1\b DB Lat Pull-Over
\f0\b0 \
11:14\
dumbbell LP pullover is the same basic\
11:16\
movement except with the dumbbell you\
11:17\
have much more tension on your lats at\
11:19\
the bottom and very little tension at\
11:21\
the top now this isn't such a bad thing\
11:23\
though because the stretch is most\
11:24\
likely the most anabolic part of the\
11:26\
range of motion anyway so as long as you\
11:28\
cut out the very top end of the range of\
11:30\
motion I'd also put these in a tier so\
11:33\
out of the S tier list if I had to Crown\
11:34\
just one exercise as the best of the\
11:36\
best I think I'd go with a chest\
11:38\
supported row it's just so good for\
11:40\
smashing both the lats and the midback\
11:43\
and there are so many effective ways to\
11:44\
do it and if I had to pick one exercise\
11:46\
as the worst of the worst it' probably\
11:48\
be the Renegade row as a hypertrophy\
11:50\
exercise there's just not enough\
11:51\
stability to maximize tension and if\
11:53\
you're looking to put all this\
11:54\
information to use with a science-based\
11:56\
program that you can just go to the gym\
11:57\
and execute I'd strongly recommend\
11:59\
picking up my 10-week pure bodybuilding\
12:01\
program the program got extremely high\
12:02\
praise from other experts in the field\
12:04\
and it's easily my most highly rated\
12:06\
program ever so I'll put a link to that\
12:08\
over here next to my head and don't\
12:09\
forget to leave me a thumbs up if you\
12:10\
enjoyed the video subscribe if you\
12:12\
haven't already and I'll see you guys\
