# HealthRAG

A completely **FREE**, **local** AI-powered health and fitness advisor that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide personalized advice from your own fitness and nutrition documents.

## Why HealthRAG?

- **💰 Zero Cost**: No API fees, completely free to run
- **🔒 100% Private**: Your data never leaves your machine
- **🚀 No API Keys**: Uses local Ollama or Apple Silicon MLX
- **📚 Your Documents**: Query your personal library of fitness PDFs
- **⚡ Fast**: Optimized for Apple Silicon with MLX support

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Local Development (Python venv)

**One-time setup:**
```bash
# Run the automated setup script (installs all dependencies)
chmod +x setup_dependencies.sh
./setup_dependencies.sh
```

**Daily usage:**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment (includes ZBar library path for barcode scanning)
source activate_venv.sh

# Start the application
streamlit run src/main.py

# Access at: http://localhost:8501
```

**To deactivate:**
```bash
deactivate
```

### Option 2: Docker (Cross-Platform, Recommended)

```bash
# Start everything with one command
./start_healthrag.sh

# Or manually:
docker-compose up --build

# Access at: http://localhost:8501
```

### Option 3: Local MLX (macOS Only - Faster)

```bash
# Run the setup script
./run_local_mlx.sh

# Or manually:
source venv_mlx/bin/activate
streamlit run src/main.py

# Access at: http://localhost:8501
```

## Adding Your Documents

1. Copy your PDF files to `data/pdfs/`
2. Run the processing script:
   ```bash
   python3 process_pdfs.py
   ```
3. Ask questions about your documents!

## Usage Examples

Ask questions like:
- "What's the Renaissance Periodization approach to muscle gain?"
- "How should I structure my workout for hypertrophy?"
- "What's the optimal protein intake for body recomposition?"
- "What does Jeff Nippard recommend for training volume?"

## Features

### Dual Backend Support
- **MLX Backend**: Native Apple Silicon acceleration (M1/M2/M3)
- **Ollama Backend**: Docker-based, works on any platform

### Smart Document Processing
- Automatic PDF chunking (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
- Persistent vector store
- Error handling for corrupted files

### Grounded Responses
- Only answers from your documents
- Source attribution
- No hallucination - explicit when info not available

### 📷 Camera Barcode Scanning (Privacy-First)
- **Privacy-focused**: Camera OFF by default, user must explicitly enable
- **Automatic detection**: Uses pyzbar to decode UPC/EAN barcodes
- **Instant lookup**: Queries Open Food Facts database (2.8M+ products)
- **Full nutrition info**: Calories, protein, carbs, fat, serving sizes
- **Quick logging**: Add scanned products directly to food log
- **Manual fallback**: Original manual entry always available
- **Success rate**: 70-80% in good conditions (lighting, centering)

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to: "🍽️ Nutrition Tracking" → "🔍 Search & Add" tab
2. Click "📷 Enable Camera" button
3. Position barcode to webcam (centered, good lighting)
4. Take photo - automatic detection + product lookup
5. Select servings/meal type and add to log
6. Click "🚫 Disable Camera" when done

## Configuration

Edit `config/settings.py` to customize:

```python
DATA_PATH = "data/pdfs"              # PDF directory
VECTORSTORE_PATH = "data/vectorstore" # Vector DB location
CHUNK_SIZE = 1000                     # Text chunk size
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 200                   # Chunk overlap
RETRIEVAL_K = 5                       # Number of docs to retrieve
```

## Backend Switching

Switch between backends in the Streamlit UI:
1. MLX (Apple Silicon) - Faster, macOS only
2. Ollama (Docker) - Cross-platform

Or configure in code:
```python
from src.rag_system import HealthRAG

# Use MLX
rag = HealthRAG(backend="mlx")

# Use Ollama
rag = HealthRAG(backend="ollama")

# Switch backends
rag.switch_backend("mlx")
```

## Performance

- **First Run**: Downloads ~4-8GB model (one time)
- **Embedding**: Once per document (cached)
- **Query Response**: 5-15 seconds typical
- **Works Offline**: After initial setup

## Requirements

### Docker Option
- Docker Desktop
- 16GB RAM recommended
- 10GB disk space for models

### MLX Option
- macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
- Python 3.10+
- 16GB RAM recommended
- 10GB disk space for models

## Troubleshooting

### Corrupted PDF
One known issue: `thePaleoSolution_FoodMatrix.pdf` is corrupted. The system automatically skips it. Replace with a valid copy if available.

### MLX Not Available
If MLX isn't available, the system falls back to Ollama automatically.

### Ollama Connection Error
Make sure Docker is running or Ollama is started:
```bash
ollama serve
```

### Port Already in Use
Change ports in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8502:8501"  # Change 8502 to any available port
```

## Development

### Adding Tests
```bash
# Create tests in tests/ directory
pytest tests/
```

### Processing New PDFs
```bash
python3 process_pdfs.py
```

### Rebuilding Vector Store
```bash
rm -rf data/vectorstore/
python3 process_pdfs.py
```

## Privacy & Security

- **All processing is local** - No cloud APIs
- **Your documents stay private** - Never uploaded anywhere
- **No telemetry** - No tracking or analytics
- **Open source** - Audit the code yourself

## Known Limitations

- PDF-only support (no Word docs, images, etc.)
- English language optimized (other languages may vary)
- Requires significant RAM for large document collections
- Response quality depends on your document quality
